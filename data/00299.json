We carried out an integrative, longitudinal study combining genetic, transcriptional, and immunologic data in humans given seasonal influenza vaccine. We identified 20 genes exhibiting a transcriptional response to vaccination, significant genotype effects on gene expression, and correlation between the transcriptional and antibody responses. The results show that variation at the level of genes involved in membrane trafficking and antigen processing significantly influences the human response to influenza vaccination. More broadly, we demonstrate that an integrative study design is an efficient alternative to existing methods for the identification of genes involved in complex traits."

By presenting a weakened (or dead) form of a pathogen, or its toxins or surface proteins, to the immune system, vaccines trigger the production of antibodies against the virus or microorganism. If a vaccinated individual then encounters the pathogen, their immune system should be able to recognize and destroy it. Many vaccines also include a secondary agent, known as an adjuvant, to further stimulate the immune response."

Seasonal epidemics occur each year affecting 2‚Äì7% of the population. According to the World Health Organization, influenza leads to nearly 5 million hospitalizations each year and causes up to half a million deaths. Vaccination is a primary strategy for the prevention of seasonal influenza, but responses to the vaccine vary markedly, partly because of variation in the genetic makeup or genotype of individuals. However, the details of how genes influence response to vaccination, and indeed susceptibility to influenza, remain unclear."

Attempts at immunization pre-dated the isolation of the virus from humans in 1933 (Smith et al., 1933) and vaccination remains the cornerstone of prevention strategies. Since 1977, strains of influenza A (H3N2), influenza A (H1N1), and influenza B have been responsible for the majority of documented human infections and trivalent vaccines are updated annually to contain the circulating strains. Animal models have demonstrated that immune responses and susceptibility to influenza infection can be strongly influenced by host genetic factors (Trammell and Toth, 2008; Srivastava et al., 2009). As with viral infection, variability in the immune response to vaccination is likely to be influenced by genotype. Accordingly, twin and sibling studies have shown heritability estimates as high as 45% for a varicella vaccine (Klein et al., 2007) and 90% for a measles vaccine (Tan et al., 2001). Studies investigating influenza vaccine immunogenicity in humans have consistently shown large inter-individual variability, but the genetic contribution to this variability remains poorly understood."

Moreover, genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of variants associated with human disease risk that are also eQTL, implying that the mechanism by which they influence risk involves variation in transcriptional responses (Emilsson et al., 2008; Cookson et al., 2009; Naukkarinen et al., 2010; Nicolae et al., 2010; Rotival et al., 2011; Barreiro et al., 2012) Finally, integrative genomic studies in model organisms (Schadt et al., 2005; Amit et al., 2009) have demonstrated that the combination of genetic and transcriptional information can allow direct tests of causal mechanisms in controlled experiments. We hypothesized that integrating genome-wide genotype data with serial measurements of the transcriptional and humoral responses to an influenza vaccine in a clinical study could be used to identify loci that influence vaccine responsiveness and subsequent immunity to influenza in humans."

We began by identifying SNP-transcript pairs with both significant evidence of a cis-acting eQTL and significant changes in gene expression in response to vaccination. Thresholds for local significance were initially explored, since only SNPs flanking each reporter sequence were tested for cis association. In the discovery cohort, 3229 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 408 unique genes, exhibited significant genotype-expression association (genotype effect p<1 √ó 10‚àí4) and concomitant evidence of a transcriptional response to the vaccine (day effect p<0.01). Of these, 2606 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 256 genes, were validated in the independent cohort of female volunteers (genotype effect p<0.05 and day effect p<0.01). When more stringent thresholds were applied, 756 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 114 unique genes, exhibited significant genotype-expression association (genotype effect p<5 √ó 10‚àí8) and concomitant evidence of a transcriptional response to the vaccine (day effect p<0.01) in the discovery cohort. Of these, 654 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 93 genes, were validated in the second cohort (genotype effect p<0.05 and day effect p<0.01). A majority of these (467 SNP-transcript pairs, corresponding to 78 unique genes) would pass equally stringent thresholds in both cohorts (genotype effect p<5 √ó 10‚àí8, day effect p<0.01). A Manhattan plot of these results is presented in Figure 1. Data for the individual SNP-transcript pairs that passed equally stringent thresholds in both cohorts, including results of significance testing and gene identifiers, are provided in Table 1 via the Interactive Results Tool (which is also available to download from Zenodo and shown within Supplementary file 1)."

This type of effect, which would not be observed in a cross-sectional study design, could be directly examined with our serial expression data. We analyzed the additive effect of genotype on expression at each day in the study. Using a cis-effect significance threshold of p<1 √ó 10‚àí4 in the discovery cohort and p<0.05 in the validation cohort, this analysis identified 5155 validated eQTL SNP-transcript pairs (3011 at baseline and 3417, 2496, and 3043 at days 1, 3, and 14, respectively). These SNP-transcript pairs correspond to 543 unique genes. We then identified the SNP-transcript pairs in which the expression variance explained was most strongly increased after vaccination (highest change in genetic variance explained, which we termed delta-Rg2). This analysis revealed multiple loci at which the genetic effect was either enhanced or only apparent after the experimental perturbation. An example is presented in Figure 2A, which displays local Manhattan plots for the NECAB2 locus before and 3 days after vaccination in both cohorts."

We analyzed all SNP-transcript pairs for loci at which we observed both a strong cis-acting eQTL and a transcriptional response to vaccination, calculating the relative magnitude of slope and within-genotype variance between the pre-vaccination and maximal Rg2 time points. Figure 2B shows that an increase in the strength of the genotype effect (slope of the additive association) was the main driver for the observed change in Rg2, and that this amplitude change was a general feature of the loci in which we observed both a strong cis-acting eQTL and a transcriptional response to the vaccine stimulus. The delta-Rg2 values were consistent between the cohorts when evaluated by Spearman‚Äôs rank correlation analysis using all SNP-transcript pairs (Cor = 0.25, p<2 √ó 10‚àí16). To select a conservative set of candidate loci based on this property for further analysis, we identified the SNP-transcript pairs that were in the top 1% of the delta-Rg2 distribution and also showed evidence of a strong cis-acting eQTL (genotype effect p<5 √ó 10‚àí8), in both cohorts. Data for the resulting set of 146 SNP-transcript pairs, including Rg2 values, are provided in Table 2 via the Interactive Results Tool (which is also available to download from Zenodo and shown within Supplementary file 1)."

We now considered alternative models for the relationships between these distinct types of association (Figure 7A), and we evaluated our data to determine which of these alternatives appears most consistent with our observations. The alternative models considered were: (i) genotype association with gene expression is independent of genotype association or trends of association with antibody response (independent model); (ii) genotype association or trends of association with antibody response are mediated by gene expression patterns that are strongly correlated with genotype (causal model); and (iii) genotype associations to antibody response are not mediated by expression, but instead gene expression patterns are a response to the antibody trait or its early correlates (reactive model). To perform a comparative analysis of these alternatives we extended the framework for causal modeling (Pearl, 2010) in eQTL data recently developed by others (Millstein et al., 2009) and applied the method to our time-course gene expression study. We used the 137 eQTL SNP-transcript pairs from the 20 loci with the strongest evidence of genetic variation influencing the immune response to the vaccine, as described above. We found that the patterns in the data trend toward the causal model compared to the reactive model (Figure 7B), but a power analysis based on the distribution of the empirical effect sizes of our observed associations also indicates that our sample size is too modest to support definitive conclusions (Figure 7C)."

In the independent model, expression and trait each associate with genotype but are not themselves directly related. In the causal model, expression mediates the association between genotype and trait. In the reactive model, genotype and expression relate through the trait, so that gene expression changes are a downstream response to the trait. (B) p-values for independent-versus-reactive and independent-versus-causal hypothesis tests. Each point shows the result for one SNP-transcript pair. Points to the right of the solid vertical line are significant (p<0.05) for the reactive hypothesis and points above the solid horizontal line are significant for the causal hypothesis. The dashed line shows a p=0.1 threshold. (C) Power for rejection of the independent hypothesis. Non-independent data were simulated with effect sizes and variances similar to those in the enrichment set (the set of SNP-transcript pairs that were found to be significant in our study). The curve shows the proportion of cases in which the simulated data rejected the independent (null) hypothesis. The dotted line indicates the combined sample size in our study."

      "content": "The results provide an unbiased integrative survey of the genetic and transcriptional components of the humoral immune response to influenza vaccination in humans. They suggest that variation at the level of genes involved in antigen processing and intracellular trafficking is an important determinant of vaccine immunogenicity. Even in healthy, young individuals, there are a significant number of people who do not develop a protective antibody response after influenza vaccination. If these individuals could be identified prior to vaccination, modifications to the type or dose of vaccine could be attempted, with the goal of reducing the number of unprotected vaccinated individuals. The genes identified in this study as playing a role in variation in the humoral response to vaccination would be a logical starting point for the development of DNA- or RNA-based predictive biomarkers. Prospective evaluation of such biomarkers would be the next step towards clinical implementation."

Most of the efforts to date have focused on vaccine adjuvants that activate known immunologic mechanisms. Surprisingly, many of the genes identified in this study encode proteins that are not specifically immune but play a more general role in membrane trafficking and intracellular transport. Interventions aimed at increasing vaccine antigen affinity to these proteins or altering their intracellular concentrations could represent new avenues in vaccine development."

      "content": "More broadly, the results demonstrate that a longitudinal, integrative genomic analysis study design, applied to a clinical intervention, is an efficient alternative to cross-sectional methods for the identification of genes involved in medically relevant complex traits. By making repeated measurements on the same individual over time after a controlled experimental perturbation, we were able to account for individual variation in a way that would not have been possible otherwise. The dynamic nature of the measurements also allowed us to uncover genetic effects that are either enhanced by or only evident after the experimental perturbation. The specificity of gene identification in this study emerges from the genome‚Äôs acute response to the perturbation, which cannot be assessed by a cross-sectional eQTL analysis or a genome-wide association study. This approach could be used for a broad variety of medically important problems whenever there is the opportunity to test a well-controlled intervention such as drug, dietary, or vaccine responses."

      "content": "Several limitations of the study are worth noting. First, we studied two samples of healthy young adults, thereby excluding the segments of the population that are most likely to have a poor response to influenza vaccination: children, the elderly, and individuals with severe illnesses. Second, in order to minimize the risk of false associations related to population stratification, we studied an ethnically homogeneous group of individuals. Third, while an interesting aspect of our study design is that it could open the door for direct comparisons of causal and reactive models, the sample size in this study was not sufficient to establish whether or not there is a causal relationship between the loci for which an association was identified and the antibody response to the vaccine. Finally, while antibody titers have historically been used to evaluate vaccine responsiveness, it is clear that they do not capture the complexity of the human immune response to vaccination. Additional studies would be necessary to determine whether the genes identified are also related to variation in influenza vaccine responses in groups other than the one chosen for this study, whether there is a causal relationship between these genes and the antibody response, or whether they also influence the cell-mediated immune response to the vaccine."

(C) Integrative analysis involved identification of loci that exhibit a transcriptional response to vaccination, evidence of genetic regulation of expression (constitutive eQTL), evidence of correlation between gene expression and the antibody response, and evidence of correlation between genotype and the antibody response (QTL). Because transcript abundance was measured serially, we were able to evaluate changes in the magnitude of the genetic effect on expression at different time points following vaccination. In addition, the study design permitted QTL analysis conditional on gene expression, which led to the identification of loci whose genetic effects on the antibody response are causally linked through the eQTL."

      "content": "Array quality was initially assessed using GenomeStudio software (Illumina, Inc.). Default algorithms were used to normalize, generate SNP clusters, and make genotype calls. SNPs with minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.05 and Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) œá2 < 1 √ó 10‚àí7 were removed prior to analysis. For local eQTL mapping, we restricted the analyses to SNPs within 1 Mb (500 kb upstream or downstream) of each unambiguously mapped expression reporter sequence. We used the genotype information to reliably establish that the individuals in each cohort were indeed unrelated and ethnically matched. For this, we estimated pairwise identity-by-descent (IBD) metrics on the basis of identity-by-state (IBS) information from their genome-wide SNP genotyping results, followed by multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis on the resulting matrix of pairwise distances, using PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007). The first three components of the MDS analysis on our study samples and the founders from six HapMap populations were plotted with R package Scatterplot3D (Ligges and Machler, 2003) and are shown in Figure 9. As expected, our study samples from both cohorts cluster with the HapMap CEU population. In the male cohort, we identified four pairs of individuals with cryptic or undisclosed familial relationships (pi-hat ‚â• 0.125). 12 outliers were identified by component 2; two of the four pairs of cryptic or undisclosed relatives were among the outliers. One individual from each related pair and all remaining outliers were removed prior to analysis. In the female cohort, we identified one pair of individuals with cryptic or undisclosed familial relationship (pi-hat ‚â• 0.125). 11 outliers were identified by component 2 and one by component 1. One individual from the related pair and all outliers were removed prior to analysis."

We fit this model using the R package nlme and the estimation method of the same name. The day effect (D) is a shift term which considers time-ordered change in expression. The genotype effect (g) is a main effect for genotype that considers the expression differences between genotypes to be additively related to the number of copies of a reference allele. The day‚Äìgenotype interaction allows the additive effect to vary by day (see Figure 10 for a visual representation of the analysis scheme). The person effect (P) is modeled as a random effect; this term helps to efficiently account for the fact that the same individual appears in each time point, without overfitting the expression model to the particular sample ascertained in our study. We explored different parametrizations, such as allowing the person effect to vary by day, and found that the simplest model with a single term for each person was effective. This person effect can account for inter-individual or batch differences which are stable within individuals for the duration of the study."

This allowed estimates of the proportion of expression variance explained by individual genotypes from the model‚Äôs coefficient of determination (R2g). This model permitted a more detailed examination of the changes in the strength of the genotypic association with expression at each time point. To detect SNP-transcript pairs where the magnitude of the genotype effect varied after immunization, we took the difference in R2g measures (ŒîR2g) from pairwise linear models fitted after (days 1, 3 and 14) and before vaccination (day 0). We then took the top 1% ŒîR2g values between day 0 and a later time point.

The term G has a separate effect on the trait under the independent null model, while under the causal alternative, where it acts through gene expression, its influence is entirely transmitted through E. The statistic used to assess the influence of G is the partial F reported by the ‚Äòaov‚Äô function in R (version 2.15.1). The analyses utilize an equivalence test approach, where the null hypothesis is that the second independent variable has an effect on the response conditional on the first variable, while the alternative is complete co-linearity in the associations. The null distribution of the F statistic‚Äìwhich under parametric assumptions would have a non-central F distribution‚Äîis derived using a permutation test procedure, as follows: The relationship between E and T is decoupled by regressing E on G, permuting the resulting residuals, then adding the permuted residuals to the predicted values to arrive at E*, which is independent of T but maintains the marginal variance and G-correlation of E. This procedure enforces the assumption of the independent model, while leaving other properties unchanged. The partial F statistic for G in"

The study design for the discovery cohort, therefore, sought to minimize the effects of suspected variables, such as previous vaccine exposure, ethnicity, age, and sex. The follow-up study was designed to fill the resulting gap in information about responses to the seasonal influenza vaccine in women. We agree that the consequence of this feature of the data is confounding of potential sex-specific effects with other technical variables in the trials. However, it should not result in confounding with other biologically important variation, particularly in the validation of eQTLs. The literature is inconsistent with respect to terminology, but we prefer to make the distinction between the terms ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù and ‚Äúreplication‚Äù (Igl et. al Hum Hered 2009; 67: 66-68)."

The sign of the additive effect does not change across the days, but the magnitude tends to increase after vaccination. We therefore speculate that our sample size does not provide sufficient power to exploit the interaction terms. Future larger studies may allow more precise estimates of the time √ó gene interaction and allow identification of additional vaccine response loci beyond those detected here."

For this analysis, we first computed the R2 between SNP (genotype at SNPs that were validated eQTL and where gene expression was associated with the magnitude of the antibody response) and antibody response using an additive model. We then performed a regression analysis predicting antibody response from gene expression and we used the residuals from that analysis to perform another association analysis. We observed that the association between SNP and antibody, as measured by non-zero R2 values, disappeared after accounting for gene expression. This reduction in R2 was not observed in randomly-sampled sets of SNPs. The preceding data showed that the SNPs used are eQTL and that gene expression changes (e.g., day 1 post-vaccine) precede the change in antibody titers (day 28). Taken together, these observations support the interpretation that the predictive information in the genotype for the change in antibody titer is mediated by gene expression. This analysis supports a causal role for these genes in the change in antibody titer."

Specifically, utilizing a pairwise comparison (difference) between time points as the substrate for the eQTL analysis would lead to an increase in the technical variance of the phenotype, as the sum of two independent (technical) errors has twice the variance of an individual measurement. We agree with the reviewer that our interest is in investigating the source of changes in R2 explained on each day, and we analyzed this change in R2 to show that (a) in principle, R2 for the explanatory power of the genotype increases in the days after vaccination, and (b) this change is due to an increase in the magnitude of the additive effect, and not in a change in the dispersion of the errors across days."

We agree that the metric is not well defined in terms of the type I error, and that we should avoid the term ‚Äòvalidation‚Äô in this setting. The manuscript has been modified to reflect this change. However, our data shows that the delta-Rg2 is a stable property of SNP-transcript pairs in both cohorts. To more objectively illustrate this, we evaluated the Spearman's rank correlation of the delta-Rg2 between the two cohorts using all SNP-transcript pairs (Cor = 0.25, p < 2x10-16). This information has been added to the manuscript. To select a conservative set of candidate loci based on this phenomenon, we chose to impose a stringent intersection rule, requiring a threshold of the top 1% of the delta-Rg2 distribution in both cohorts, in addition to evidence of a strong cis- acting eQTL (genotype effect p < 5 √ó 10-8) in both cohorts. The manuscript was modified to clarify that the 146 SNP-transcript pairs that were selected for further analysis comprise the set that passed this strict intersection rule."

An important advantage of experimental designs such as ours is the opportunity to consider relationships between these distinct types of association. To respond to the reviewing editor's questions and to more formally evaluate alternative models, we have now adapted the approach recently published by Eric Schadt and colleagues (Millstein et al., 2009), which provides a statistical testing framework for so-called causal versus reactive model analyses. This work is related to ideas and methods developed by Judea Pearl and others, but more specifically applied to the context of eQTL data. Under this approach, a formal statistical hypothesis test is developed for evaluating three possible scenarios, referred to as independent, causal and reactive models."

Two separate p-values are generated, considering both the causal and reactive scenarios against the null model of independence. Details of our approach are described in the Methods section of the paper and the results of the analyses are presented in Figure 7B and described in the text. In keeping with the Reviewing editor's comments, and in an attempt to more globally evaluate the trend observed in our data, we performed a large-scale simulation under a null model that used permutation to sever the connection between eQTL and expression-to-trait associations. In each permutation, we selected a set of candidate SNP-transcript pairs that passed eQTL and expression-to-permuted-phenotype association. We examined the causal versus reactive p-value distributions for these simulation-based results. In no instance did we observe the trend towards the causal versus the reactive model that was observed in our data."
