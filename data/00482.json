In the complex, Pol Î± and primase cooperate in the production of RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime synthesis of new DNA. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic core of yeast Pol Î± in unliganded form, bound to an RNA primer/DNA template and extending an RNA primer with deoxynucleotides. We combine the structural analysis with biochemical and computational data to demonstrate that Pol Î± specifically recognizes the A-form RNA/DNA helix and that the ensuing synthesis of B-form DNA terminates primer synthesis. The spontaneous release of the completed RNA-DNA primer by the Pol Î±/primase complex simplifies current models of primer transfer to leading- and lagging strand polymerases. The proposed mechanism of nucleotide polymerization by Pol Î± might contribute to genomic stability by limiting the amount of inaccurate DNA to be corrected at the start of each Okazaki fragment."

      "content": "During mitosis, a cell duplicates its DNA and then divides, ultimately generating two genetically identical daughter cells. In eukaryotes, the process of DNA duplication occurs at multiple sites throughout the genome: at each site, the antiparallel strands of the parental DNA separate and provide a template for DNA polymerase (Pol), the enzyme that synthesizes the two new DNA strands. Duplication of the DNA proceeds in both directions from each site through the polymerization of nucleotides to form new strands of DNA that are complementary to the template strands. However, since DNA polymerases can only polymerize nucleotides in one direction, the 5â² to 3â² direction, synthesis of the so-called leading strand proceeds continuously, whereas the other, lagging strand is synthesized in fragments."

      "content": "The task of duplicating the bulk of the DNA is shared between Pol Î´, which is primarily responsible for synthesis of the lagging strand, and Pol Îµ, which fulfils the same role for the leading strand. However, Pols Î´ and Îµ cannot initiate DNA synthesis by themselves; short RNA-DNA chains called primers must also be paired to each template strand. Production of the primers requires the concerted action of two more enzymes: an RNA polymerase known as primase, and another DNA polymerase called Pol Î±. It is known that completion of the RNA-DNA primer requires Pol Î± to increase the length of the RNA segment by adding extra nucleotides, but the details of this process are poorly understood."

They found that Pol Î± recognizes the particular shape of double helixâan A-form helixâthat is formed by the DNA template and the RNA primer. The geometry of this helix prompts the Pol Î± enzyme to start adding nucleotides to the RNA in the primer. Perera et al. determined that once a full turn of double-helix DNA has been synthesized, Pol Î± is no longer in direct contact with the A-form helix, which causes the enzyme to disengage and terminate polymerization, leaving behind the now complete RNA-DNA primer."

Their work suggests that Pol Î± has the ability to discriminate between different shapes of the primer-template helix, thus providing a mechanistic understanding of primer release. The spontaneous release of the primer offers a simple and elegant way to limit DNA synthesis by Pol Î±, a polymerase that is prone to error, and to make the RNA-DNA primer directly available for extension by Pol Î´ and Pol Îµ."

The RNA primers are extended in an obligate 5â² to 3â² direction by the replicative DNA polymerases that synthesize the bulk of chromosomal DNA. The initiation of DNA synthesis is made more complicated by the concurrent duplication of the antiparallel strands of parental DNA (Hamdan and van Oijen, 2010). The repeated priming events necessary for the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand require the constant activity of primase at the replication fork."

The molecular apparatus responsible for initiation of DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication is more complex. The eukaryotic primase is a heterodimer of catalytic and regulatory subunits that is associated with the catalytic subunit of Pol Î± and its accessory B subunit in a constitutive heterotetrameric assembly, the Pol Î±/primase complex (Loeb et al., 1986; Kaguni and Lehman, 1988; Foiani et al., 1997; Lao-Sirieix et al., 2005b). Reflecting its critical importance to DNA replication, the Pol Î±/primase complex is an integral component of the eukaryotic replisome (Calzada et al., 2005)."

      "content": "The oligonucleotides synthesized by bacterial and bacteriophage primases are between 4 and 12 nucleotides long and made exclusively of RNA. In contrast, the Pol Î±/primase complex produces longer, composite RNA-DNA primers that result from the concerted enzymatic activities of primase and Pol Î± (Chang et al., 1984; Hu et al., 1984; Singh, et al., 1986). The constitutive association of Pol Î± and primase in the cell reflects presumably their tight functional coordination, demanded by the frequent priming necessary for lagging strand synthesis. Detailed knowledge of the mechanism of primer synthesis is lacking, but it must involves initiation, extension and completion of RNA synthesis by primase, intramolecular hand-off of the RNA oligonucleotide to Pol Î± and limited RNA extension with deoxynucleotides (dNTPs) (Brooks and Dumas, 1989; Kuchta et al., 1990; Copeland and Wang, 1993; Sheaff and Kuchta, 1993; Sheaff et al., 1994). The large subunit of primase performs a critical function in the primer initiation step via its Fe-S domain (Klinge et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2007), whereas the B subunit of Pol Î± lacks enzymatic activity and likely acts as a scaffold to mediate interactions with other components of the replicative apparatus (Uchiyama and Wang, 2004; Klinge et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012)."

Synchronization of priming with Okazaki fragment synthesis requires a concerted mode of primer transfer from Pol Î± to Pol Î´ and several mechanisms of polymerase switch have been put forward (Yuzhakov et al., 1999; Maga et al., 2000). Before ligation of the completed Okazaki fragments, the RNA portion of the primer is excised by specific nucleases such as Fen1 and Dna2 (Burgers, 2009). The composite nature of the RNA-DNA primers poses a special challenge to the eukaryotic replication apparatus, that must further correct the DNA segment synthesized by Pol Î±, which lacks proofreading activity; current evidence indicates that the DNA portion of the primer might be corrected by Pol Î´ (Pavlov et al., 2006)."

Here we use a multi-disciplinary approach to elucidate the structural basis for the catalytic role of Pol Î± in the synthesis of the RNA-DNA oligonucleotides that prime DNA synthesis in eukaryotic replication. We demonstrate that Pol Î± recognizes the intrinsic and induced conformation of the A-form RNA primer/DNA template helix and that the resulting synthesis of B-form DNA forms the basis for a feedback mechanism of primer termination. Our findings provide a new paradigm for a critical step in the complex choreography of events that ultimately lead to replication of the lagging DNA strand."

For structural studies of the ternary complex, we used a polymerase mutant (D998N) with attenuated catalytic activity. During crystallization of the ternary complex, the polymerase extended the 3â²-end of the RNA primer by addition of two deoxyguanosine nucleotides. Thus, our crystal structure captures the actively copying Pol Î± in the act of extending the RNA primer with deoxynucleotides (Figure 1A and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1â4, Table 1)."

Interactions of the palm domain with the primer-template help position the 3â²-terminus of the primer in optimal arrangement for catalysis, whereas the thumb domain secures the grip of the polymerase onto the DNA duplex. Strikingly, the structure of Pol Î± bound productively to RNA primer/DNA template shows that, although the palm domain makes a canonical set of interactions with the first 3 bp of the primer-template helix, the thumb domain engages almost exclusively with the RNA primer strand (Figure 2A,B)."

      "content": "The contiguous pair of invariant arginine residues 1075 and 1076 straddles the ribose-phosphate backbone between nucleotides three and four from the 3â²-end of the RNA primer (Figure 3). The side chain of Arg1075 extends into the minor groove and packs its guanidinium moiety against the ribose sugar of Ade4 (Figures 2C and 3A), thus engaging in an interaction that matches closely the contact made by the equivalent Arg839 of yeast Pol Î´ with the DNA primer (Figure 3B). However, in the case of Pol Î± the close contact with Arg1075 induces a local rearrangement of the RNA conformation, which includes a B-DNA C2â²-endo ribose pucker for Ade4 and unstacking between the aromatic bases of nucleotides four and five (Figure 3A,C). The local conformation of the RNA primer is stabilized by insertion of the Arg1076 side chain between the phosphate groups of nucleotides three and four (Figures 2C and 3C,D). The âsnap-clip' interaction of arginines 1075 and 1076 with the RNA backbone anchors the RNA primer to the thumb domain of Pol Î±, by facilitating the formation of three hydrogen bonds between the phosphate groups of nucleotides four, five and six and the mainchain nitrogens of residues Arg1076, Lys1132 and Ser1134, respectively (Figure 3D)."

The result of the structural study prompted us to investigate whether the polymerase activity of Pol Î± reflected such specificity. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of the polymerase domain of yeast Pol Î± to extend with deoxynucleotides a templated primer made of either RNA or DNA. Whereas Pol Î± displayed only weak activity and limited processivity when extending a DNA primer, extension of an RNA primer resulted in much higher levels of polymerization (Figure 4A). Strikingly, the profile of RNA-dependent extension products showed a pronounced peak at between 10 to 12 nucleotides, indicating strong processivity limited to a full-turn of double helix (Figure 4A,B). Such characteristics of the catalytic activity of Pol Î± were observed for the isolated polymerase core as well as the Pol Î± /primase complex and are independent of primer size (Figure 4C)."

Elongation of the RNA primer with deoxynucleotides would cause translocation of the polymerase beyond the RNA/DNA duplex region and onto B-DNA, with loss of the RNA-specific contacts, eventually causing Pol Î± to stall and terminate primer synthesis. We sought to test this mechanism of primer termination by design of DNA primer sequences with altered conformational properties. It is known that, although double-stranded DNA normally adopts a B-DNA conformation, its structure can display pronounced conformational variation depending on the local sequence of bases. Short runs of consecutive deoxyguanosine nucleotides can induce A-like DNA conformation in double-stranded DNA (Svozil et al., 2008; Marathe et al., 2009). We examined the ability of Pol Î± to extend a templated oligo(dA) primer with increasing deoxyguanylate content, introduced incrementally as di- and tri-nucleotides. Indeed, as the deoxyguanosine content of the DNA primer increased, the size profile of the extension products synthesized by Pol Î± changed from that expected of a DNA primer to that of an RNA primer (Figure 4D)."

Further insight as to the possible structural basis for a termination mechanism can be obtained by comparing the structures of isolated and actively copying Pol Î±, which reveals a striking difference in the position of the thumb domain. In order to adopt the conformation observed in ternary complex, the thumb domain of Pol Î± must rotate inwards by about 20Â°, a large conformational rearrangement compared for instance with the limited movement of the thumb domain observed in structures of isolated and copying RB69 Pol (Figure 5A). The large difference in the position of the thumb domain in the ternary complex and in the isolated polymerase suggests a molecular basis for the release of the completed primer-template by Pol Î±: loss of the interactions with the primer-template duplex would allow the thumb domain to rotate away from the DNA, terminating the productive engagement of the polymerase with its substrate."

Principal component analysis of the trajectories shows that the actively copying polymerase maintains a stable conformation over the 100 ns duration of the simulation. In comparison, the structure of the isolated polymerase displays considerable conformational fluctuations, indicative of large-scale conformational changes and local loss of secondary structure that affect in particular the N-amino terminal region and the thumb domain. Importantly, the conformational flexibility of the isolated polymerase does not seem to be sufficient to sample conformations adopted by the polymerase in the ternary complex."

The trajectory showed an increased conformational instability, accompanied by a tendency to relax towards the apo conformation of the polymerase (Figure 5C and Video 1). Taken together, the results of the molecular dynamics simulations indicate that Pol Î± reaches the active conformation observed in the ternary complex via an âinduced fit' mechanism that is dependent on its interactions with the RNA/DNA duplex and deoxynucleotide. Loss of the optimal set of protein-RNA contacts would weaken the grip of the polymerase on its primer/template substrate and promote primer release."

      "content": "Rotation of the palm domain is accompanied by a conformational rearrangement of region II that is necessary in order to accommodate the phosphoribose moiety of the incoming nucleotide (Figure 6B). The two copies of binary complex present in the asymmetric unit of the crystals capture intermediate states of the transition, as in one binary complex the conformation of region II is apo-like, whereas in the second copy region II adopts a conformation akin to that observed in the ternary complex. The range of positions adopted by the palm domain in the apo, binary and ternary complex structures suggests that adoption of an active conformation by Pol Î± might require a wider set of conformational rearrangements than predicted by current models of DNA polymerase activity. The observed movement of the palm domain could participate in a âratchet' mechanism for unidirectional translocation of Pol Î±, as return of the palm domain to the apo conformation after catalysis would propel the polymerase forward onto the next templating base. Interestingly, site-specific mutations of Ser863 in region II of human Pol Î± (Ser867 of yeast Pol Î±), which acts as the pivot during rotation of the palm domain, cause a drastic reduction in the specific activity of the polymerase without changing its kinetic parameters, in agreement with a potential structural role of this serine residue in DNA polymerisation (Dong et al., 1993)."

Our findings provide evidence for a specific mechanism of RNA primer recognition, limited extension and termination by Pol Î±, that is encoded in the interaction of the polymerase with the hybrid RNA primer/DNA template helix (Figure 7). Recognition of the intrinsic and induced geometry of the RNA/DNA helix by Pol Î± would prompt rapid dNTP polymerization, until a full turn of DNA double helix has been synthesized. Translocation away from the RNA/DNA helix and synthesis of B-form DNA would cause Pol Î± to stall, akin to a locomotive running into railtrack of different gauge. Loss of the optimal interface contacts between Pol Î± and the primer-template helix would favor a conformational change towards the apo conformation of the polymerase, with consequent disengagement of Pol Î± from the completed RNA-DNA primer."

The ribbon model of the Pol Î±/primase complex was assembled from the crystal structures of apo Pol Î± (this manuscript), the yeast Pol Î± CTDâB subunit complex (Klinge et al., 2009), and the archaeal primase (Lao-Sirieix et al., 2005a). The location of the Pol Î±/primase complex components in the model is based on previous electron microscopy and biochemical data (Nunez-Ramirez et al., 2011; Kilkenny et al., 2012) and is not meant to give an accurate representation of their reciprocal spatial relationship. The crystal structures of isolated and copying Pol Î± and Pol Î´ are shown in spacefill representation. The model of Pol Î´ is based on PDB entry 3IAY (Swan et al., 2009). In the diagram, DNA is shown in yellow and RNA in magenta. (B) The catalytic cycle of Pol Î± consists of specific recognition of the templated RNA primer, rapid and limited primer extension with dNTPs and termination of synthesis induced by polymerization of B-form DNA. Constitutive tethering of primase to Pol Î± (not drawn in the panel; Kilkenny et al., 2012) ensures efficient recycling of Pol Î± onto the 3â²-terminus of the next RNA primer."

Uninterrupted DNA synthesis during replication depends on the tight coordination of Pol Î± function with the upstream activity of primase, that synthesizes the RNA primer, and the downstream activity of Pol Î´, that elongates the resulting RNA-DNA primers. The efficient mechanism for the rapid extension and controlled termination of RNA primers by Pol Î± uncovered here seems ideally suited for the frequently repeated, highly integrated priming events taking place on the lagging strand template. After termination of synthesis and release of the completed primer, the physical tethering of Pol Î± to primase would facilitate its recycling onto the 3â²-end of the next RNA primer (Nunez-Ramirez et al., 2011; Kilkenny et al., 2012)."

Spontaneous primer release once a helical equivalent of deoxynucleotides has been added to the RNA primer would make the 3â²-terminus of the RNA-DNA primer directly available for extension by Pol Î´ and Pol Îµ, the DNA polymerases that synthesize the bulk of genomic DNA. Such a mechanism provides a straightforward model of primer hand-off in eukaryotic replication, by removing the need for molecular transactions between primer-bound Pol Î± and the replicative apparatus deputed to leading and lagging strand synthesis. We note that, although the molecular details differ, the mechanism of primer release by Pol Î± described here is conceptually similar to the mechanism of polymerase switching proposed for Pol Î· after lesion by-pass (Biertumpfel et al., 2010; Silverstein et al., 2010): for both polymerases, termination of DNA synthesis appears to be a direct consequence of the specific way in which they interact with their nucleic acid substrate."

Our work has highlighted a previously unappreciated functional similarity between primase and Pol Î±, as extension of an RNA primer by Pol Î± leads to controlled termination of synthesis, in a functionally analogous manner to the known counting ability of primase. This functional symmetry in the behavior of the two polymerases responsible for priming DNA synthesis seems logical, as the lack of proof-reading ability by Pol Î± poses a potential threat to genomic stability. Thus, in addition to excising the RNA portion of the primer, eukaryotic replication faces the additional challenge of correcting possible mismatches introduced by Pol Î± in the DNA segment of the primer. How mistakes made by Pol Î± are corrected by the replication apparatus has not been fully elucidated yet but current evidence points to a proofreading role of Pol Î´ (Pavlov et al., 2006). The mechanism of primer termination indicated by our findings would constitute a simple and elegant way to limit the extent of inaccurate DNA that needs to be corrected from the 5â²-terminus of each Okazaki fragment."

Catalytic Asp998 was mutated to asparagine in order to produce an inactive polymerase; unexpectedly, the D998N mutation greatly reduced but did not abolished polymerisation by Pol Î± (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1). The double mutation R508A, N509A was introduced in order to promote crystallization of the ternary complex. As expression levels of the Pol Î± mutant were lower than observed for the wild-type protein, over-expression was carried out in a 30 l BIOSTATÂ® (Sartorius Stedim UK Ltd, Epsom, UK) bioreactor. Purification of the Pol Î± mutant was carried out in the same way as for the wild-type protein."

Expression of the Pol Î±/primase complex was carried out in 30 l BIOSTATÂ® (Sartorius Stedim) bioreactor, using 20 l of auto induction media. Purification of the Pol Î±/primase complex was carried out according to a similar protocol followed for Pol Î± purification, including steps of Ni-NTA chromatography (Qiagen), Heparin sepharose chromatography (GE Healthcare), Strep-Tactin chromatography (IBA), tag removal by TEV cleavage and gel filtration chromatography. All steps of this purification were carried out at 4Â°C to avoid degradation of the complex. The purified Pol Î±/primase complex was concentrated to 20 Î¼M in 20 mM Hepes pH 7.0, 300 mM KCl, 10% glycerol buffer and divided in small aliquots that were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for functional studies."

The X-ray crystal structure of Pol Î± was determined by single-wavelength anomalous scattering using selenomethionine-labelled (SeMet) protein crystals. Pol Î± crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21, with cell dimensions: a = 74.4 Ã b = 127.1 Ã c = 74.5 Ã, Î² = 104.8Â°. X-ray diffraction data for native and SeMet crystals were collected at European Synchrotron Research Facility (ESRF) on beam line ID23-1 at the peak wavelength of the Selenium K edge. Data were indexed, integrated, scaled and merged using MOSFLM (Battye et al., 2011) and SCALA (Evans, 2011) of the CCP4 program suite (Collaborative Computational Project, 1994). Phasing and initial automatic model building of SeMet Pol Î± was carried out in PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010) and the crystallographic model was completed manually and refined at 2.67 Ã resolution in REFMAC 5.5 (Murshudov et al., 1997), BUSTER (Bricogne et al., 2011) and PHENIX, to R-factor/R-free (%) of 19.6/23.4. As SeMet Pol Î± crystallized in a different space group (orthorhombic space group P22121, cell dimensions: 74.0 Ã 127.4 Ã 144.1 Ã) determination of the native Pol Î± structure was achieved by molecular replacement with PHASER (McCoy et al., 2007), using the crystal structure of SeMet Pol Î± as search model. The crystal structure of native Pol Î± structure was refined at 2.3 Ã resolution using BUSTER and PHENIX, to R-factor/R-free (%) of 20.5/23.6. For both SeMet and native Pol Î± structures, amino acids 677â679 (3 residues), 816â847 (32 residues), 1056â1062 (7 residues), 1176â1185 (10 residues) and 1129â1258 (30 residues) were not visible or poorly ordered in the electron density maps during refinement and were therefore excluded from the final refined model. Details of data processing and crystallographic refinement are provided in Table 1."

The C-terminal helix of the thumb domain (residues 1229â1242) is disordered in the apo structure and was modeled based on its conformation in the structure of the ternary complex. After modelling of the missing loops, the Pol Î± polypeptide comprises 877 residues. In addition to the Pol Î± polypeptide, the ternary complex contains one template DNA molecule of 16 deoxyribonucleotides, one RNA primer of nine ribonucleotides extended at the 3â²-end with two deoxynucleotides and one deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). The 5â²-terminal ribonucleotide of the RNA primer was excluded from the model of ternary complex, as it makes extensive contacts with the other Pol Î± chain in the asymmetric unit and does not form a Watson-Crick base pair."

      "content": "Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the AMBER11 package, using the AMBER FF99SB force field (Wang et al., 2004). A dodecahedral box of water molecules, treated as in the TIP3P model (Jorgensen et al., 1983), was built around the complexes and a physiological concentration of 0.15 M NaCl (72 counterions each) was added to the box. The dGTP molecule, present in the HOLO structure, has been parameterized using the GAFF code, as implemented in AMBER. The following protocol was used for all the simulations: (1) in vacuo minimization (1000 steps); (2) minimization, keeping the complexes fixed, allowing water molecules and ions to equilibrate (1000 steps of steepest descent plus 1000 steps of conjugate gradient); (3) minimization of all the system, without restrictions (1000 steps of steepest descent plus 1000 steps of conjugate gradient); (4) NVT equilibration, 1 ns; (5) production phase. All calculations were performed with the CUDA-enabled version of PMEMD (Goetz, et al., 2012), using TESLA GPUs at the High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster of the University of Cambridge. Two TESLA-GPUs perform approximately 4 ns/day, when computing a system of approximately 115000 atoms. Analysis of the trajectories was performed with the AMBERTOOLS 1.5 and GROMACS packages (Hess et al., 2008)."

The covariance matrix of the APOFORCED trajectories was constructed, based on the three-dimensional positional fluctuations of C-Î± atoms from their ensemble average position, and diagonalized, creating a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues that represent the direction and the amplitude of the motion, respectively. All the trajectories were projected on the first two eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the APOFORCED trajectories, in order to compare the regions sampled along common eigenvectors and to analyze the distribution of the motion. Construction and diagonalization of the covariance matrix was performed using the g_covar command of GROMACS. Projection of structures onto eigenvectors was performed using the g_anaeig command of GROMACS. All the other analyses have been performed with GROMACS tools, such as g_rms, g_rmsf, g_cluster. AmberTools's ptraj was used for the DSSP calculations and for all the transformation of the trajectories."

      "content": "This study investigates one of the most frequent DNA transactions in a eukaryotic cell, the initiation of Okazaki fragment synthesis during nuclear DNA replication. The manuscript describes X-ray crystal structures of the catalytic subunit of yeast DNA polymerase alpha in three states (apo, bound to RNA-primed DNA, and a complete catalytic complex). The polymerase is shown to bind to an RNA/DNA helix containing a turn of A-form base pairs in the duplex upstream of the active site. Biochemical and computational results are presented that lead the authors to suggest a mechanism for the termination of primer synthesis by polymerase alpha after one helical turn, allowing transfer of the primer-template to the DNA polymerases that perform most of nuclear DNA replication. The enzyme binds selectively to the A-form helix embodied by the RNA-DNA substrate. Primer extension with deoxynucletides is expected to change the conformation of the primer-template towards a B-form helix, which would not be optimal for the observed contacts seen with the A-form primer-template in the crystal structure. Release of Pol Î± enables Pol Î´ to proceed to complete the faithful synthesis of Okazaki fragments."

The crystallographic data presented are impressive and are technically sound, and the structures are novel. The observations presented here are consistent with the authors' hypothesis about DNA release from Pol Î±, which is logical and elegant in its simplicity. This manuscript elucidates a fundamental mechanism of eukaryotic replication and will therefore be of general interest to a large group of biologists. Publication in eLife is recommended after the manuscript is revised to address the following comments."

This is a key point because that length of DNA suffices to release the RNA from the Pol binding site. The reviewers are confused by apparently contradictory statements about the length of the DNA segment synthesized in the literature. For example, reviews by Burgers (2009) [JBC 284:4041] and Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] both state that â¼20 nt of DNA are synthesized. If 20 nts of DNA are synthesized, the duplex bound by DNA polymerase Î± would be all DNA, and the structural features that are suggested to be important for termination would no longer be relevant. We recognize that both reviews simply state this âfactâ without attribution, but a review by Balakrishnan and Bambara (2011) [JBC 286:6865] clearly states that experiments with the SV40 system shows synthesis of â¼20 nucleotides of DNA by the primase. What is the length of DNA synthesized by Pol Î± before dissociation? The authors should clear up this point of confusion by referring clearly to the literature concerning the length of DNA synthesized by Pol Î± as opposed to SV40. If this is a matter of uncertainty then the manuscript should be revised accordingly to reflect the uncertainty."

As the editor points out, the reviews by Burgers (2009) [JBC 284:4041] and Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] do not cite primary references. Furthermore, the review by Balakrishnan and Bambara (2011) [JBC 286:6865] mentioned by the editor, refers to the same review by Arezi and Kuchta (2000) [TIBS 25: 572] (penultimate sentence of page 6865), when discussing the length of DNA synthesized by Pol Î±. The current state of our knowledge concerning the length of DNA polymerised by Pol Î± and its role of in priming nucleic acid synthesis is authoritatively summarised by De Pamphilis and Bell in their recent book âGenomic Duplicationâ (2011), Garland Science. Quoting from Chapter 5, page 102: âOnce DNA synthesis begins, Pol Î± processively extends the RNA primer by approximately 10 dNMPs, and then Pol Î± begins to dissociate from the primer:template as it begins to incorporate the next 10 dNMPs, thereby allowing RNA-p-DNA primers to become accessible to other DNA polymerasesâ.

In particular, the experiments described in Figure 7 of Brooks and Dumas, (1989) [JBC 264: 3602] allow a direct estimate of the size of the DNA segment of primer polymerised by Pol Î±, with a distribution of sizes that closely matches what we observe in our extension assays.

Incorporation of two deoxynucleotides, followed by translocation onto the next templating base (position 0 in Figure 2C) and binding of a third dGTP molecule is required in order to trigger formation of the crystal lattice, capturing Pol Î± in an actively copying conformation. Figure 1âfigure supplements 6 and 7 show the non-crystallographic interaction between one polymerase molecule and the DNA/RNA duplex of the NCS-related complex, which is responsible for trapping Pol Î± in the crystal lattice and arresting further polymerisation."

We reasoned that, if addition of two dGTPs to the RNA 10mer in the crystallisation drop was necessary in order to obtain a RNA/DNA duplex of the required length (10 + 2 = 12 bp) to promote crystal growth, the same crystal form could be produced by extension of an RNA 9mer with three dGTPs (9 + 3 = 12 bp). Indeed, the crystallisation experiment with the shorter RNA primer was successful and we were able to solve the structure of the active complex, albeit at the lower resolution of 3.6 Ã (Perera and Pellegrini, unpublished data). As predicted, the new crystal structure had the same unit cell, symmetry and non- crystallographic packing of the original structure."

We have now updated the figure as suggested by the reviewer, so that it shows the active site of Pol Î± superimposed on that of yeast Pol Î´ (PDB id: 3IAY), its closest structural homologue in the PDB. The superposition shows that the geometry of Pol Î±'s active site is very closely related to that of Pol Î´; therefore, we believe that nucleotide polymerization by Pol Î± proceeds via the same two-metal ion catalysis demonstrated previously for other DNA polymerases. Due to the limited resolution of our study, we did not include Mg2+ ions in our crystallographic model."
