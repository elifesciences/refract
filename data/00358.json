      "content": "During all stages of tumor progression, cancer cells are subjected to inappropriate extracellular matrix environments and must undergo adaptive changes in order to evade growth constraints associated with the loss of matrix attachment. A gain of function screen for genes that enable proliferation independently of matrix anchorage identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus-receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4. PVRL4 promotes anchorage-independence by driving cell-to-cell attachment and matrix-independent integrin β4/SHP-2/c-Src activation. Solid tumors frequently have copy number gains of the PVRL4 locus and some have focal amplifications. We demonstrate that the transformation of breast cancer cells is dependent on PVRL4. Furthermore, growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo is inhibited by blocking PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment with monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating a novel strategy for targeted therapy of cancer."

      "content": "Epithelial tissue is one of the four major types of tissue found in animals, and is the only type of tissue that is able to form and maintain layers of cells that are just one cell thick. These layers provide inner linings to various cavities and hollow organs throughout the body—including the lungs and glandular organs such as mammary glands. A single-cell layer of epithelium is separated from the tissues beneath it by a supporting substance called the extracellular matrix. The individual cells within a single-cell layer are physically attached to the matrix, and when displaced from it, they promptly undergo programmed cell death. This mechanism preserves the single-cell layer pattern throughout the body and prevents epithelial cells from growing in inappropriate locations."

Understanding how cancerous cells gain this ability may lead to new approaches to stopping tumor cells from dividing and colonizing tissues around the body."

They found that the gene that codes for a protein called poliovirus receptor-like 4 (PVRL4) allows attachment-free cell growth and also makes cells cluster together once detached from the matrix."

      "content": "Normally, the PVRL4 gene is not active in breast epithelial cells, but its activity is detected in many breast, lung, and ovarian tumors. Moreover, cancerous cells tend to cluster together when they are detached from the extracellular matrix. This behavior is particularly evident in the cells that divide aggressively to form tumors that subsequently migrate and colonize other tissues around the body. When Pavlova et al. used genetic techniques to silence PVRL4 in cells from breast tumors, they found that it reduced the formation of clusters by the cancer cells and also reduced their ability to grow in the absence of attachment."

Epithelia have a distinct ability to form and maintain highly organized monolayers, which is reflected in their role in providing the inner lining of hollow organs. This unique architecture is dictated by the requirement for an epithelial cell to be physically anchored on a basement membrane, an organizing substratum composed of specific extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. Cells physically attach to ECM via integrins, a class of signaling molecules that serve to stimulate the survival and proliferation of cells in a matrix attachment-dependent manner (Hynes, 2002). Conversely, loss of contact with the proper ECM molecules results in initiation of a cell death program known as anoikis (Frisch and Screaton, 2001), and other constraints on cellular expansion."

Though acquired early, the ability to tolerate the loss of anchorage remains critical for the survival of cancer cells throughout the course of disease progression, encompassing stages such as invasion of the underlying stroma, extravasation into blood vessels, survival in the bloodstream, and, eventually, metastatic outgrowth at a distant site with a distinct matrix composition."

      "content": "Along with the loss of the requirement for anchorage, a propensity for self-aggregation is a characteristic of aggressive cancer cells. Thus, tumor-derived subclones with greater metastatic capacity in vivo display increased self-aggregation in vitro; at the same time, subclones selected for increased in vitro aggregation were found to be more metastatic in mice (Updyke and Nicolson, 1986; Saiki et al., 1991). Invasion of the underlying stroma is frequently undertaken by large groups of tumor cells, a phenomenon known as collective, or cohort, cell migration (Friedl and Gilmour, 2009). Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been identified from the blood samples of breast, colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer patients as well as from mouse tumor models (Molnar et al., 2001; Stott et al., 2010; Hou et al., 2011). In particular, one report demonstrated that, on average, 50% of all breast and lung CTCs exist in circulation as aggregates (Cho et al., 2012). An increase in clustering behavior is not limited to self-aggregation, as interactions with a variety of other cell types have been shown to be essential for the dissemination of cancer cells and subsequent metastatic colonization. Thus, heterotypic interactions of cancer cells with the endothelial lining within the target organ microvasculature were documented as an initiating event for metastatic lesion formation (Al-Mehdi et al., 2000). Moreover, signaling elicited by the physical association of cancer cells with other cell types, such as platelets and macrophages, has been demonstrated to be essential for successful seeding and metastatic outgrowth (Chen et al., 2011; Labelle et al., 2011). Taken together, tumor-specific cell–cell contacts can provide a multifaceted survival advantage throughout the course of pathologic progression. Targeted therapies directed towards blocking such cell–cell contacts may therefore represent a novel cancer treatment approach."

Our screen identified a cell adhesion molecule PVRL4 (poliovirus receptor-like 4), also known as Nectin-4, which we demonstrate to be a potent mediator of anchorage-independent colony formation in normal epithelial and cancer cells alike. We demonstrate that PVRL4 promotes the attachment of individual cells to each other via engaging its receptor PVRL1 on a juxtaposed cell. PVRL4-mediated cell-to-cell attachment triggers integrin β4 signaling in a matrix attachment-independent manner, and interfering with this pathway blocks PVRL4-driven anchorage-independence. Our findings point to a model in which signaling via PVRL4-PVRL1-driven cell–cell contacts serves as a surrogate for cell–matrix signaling in conditions of anchorage loss, thus enabling anoikis evasion and subsequent cellular expansion."

      "content": "To identify novel genes involved in the transformation of epithelial cells, we carried out a genetic screen for colony formation in the absence of substratum attachment using a TL-HMEC in vitro transformation system. In this model, hTERT-immortalized human mammary epithelial cells are transduced with SV40 Large T antigen (Zhao et al., 2003). TL-HMECs cannot survive and proliferate in a semi-solid medium, such as methylcellulose, in the absence of substratum attachment; however, ectopic expression of oncogenic H-RASV12, myristoylated PI3K catalytic subunit (Zhao et al., 2003), or shRNA against PTEN (Westbrook et al., 2005) enables anchorage-independent cellular expansion and formation of macroscopic colonies. We screened a retrovirus-encoded library of 8000 human open reading frames (ORFeome 1.1) (Rual et al., 2004) (Figure 1A) and individually recovered stably integrated ORFs from 732 resulting macroscopic colonies by PCR, followed by determination of the ORF identity by sequencing. Forty ORFs that were identified in two independent screen replicates were individually validated to confirm the anchorage-independent growth phenotype (Figure 1B, see also Supplementary file 1A). Eleven ORFs potently induced anchorage-independent colony formation (a fivefold increase over background), and another eight ORFs produced a moderate phenotype (a two- to fivefold increase over background). According to the recently published copy number variation analysis across a variety of tumor types (Beroukhim et al., 2010), eight out of 11 ORFs that potently induced anchorage-independent growth localized to statistically defined peaks of focal amplification in at least one tumor subtype (p=0.009, Fisher’s exact test), providing strong evidence for positive selection of these genes in cancer (Supplementary file 1B). In addition, ORFs corresponding to two genes previously shown to promote anchorage-independent colony formation were identified in our screen. Ectopic expression of SULF2 (sulfatase 2) had been previously found to induce anchorage-independent growth in human bronchial epithelial cells (Lemjabbar-Alaoui et al., 2010) and NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) overexpression had been previously found to enable NIH 3T3 fibroblast colony formation in methylcellulose (Kondo et al., 1997)."

Similarly to other nectins, PVRL4 contains an extracellular region with three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (Reymond et al., 2001). Extracellular regions of nectins engage in trans-interactions on the interface of two juxtaposed cells. Through a stretch of four C-terminal amino acids, trans-interacting nectins recruit afadin, a scaffold-like mediator of downstream signaling, triggering assembly of the afadin/Rap1/p120ctn complex, which positively regulates membrane retention of E-cadherin, assisting in adherens junction (AJ) formation in MDCK cells (Hoshino et al., 2005)."

TL-HMECs in particular do not initiate classic apoptotic responses in response to the loss of substratum attachment, likely due to the anti-apoptotic action of Large T antigen (not shown), but instead potently upregulate multiple squamous differentiation markers, including TGM1 (transglutaminase 1), KRT6A (keratin 6), and IVL (involucrin), and we found that both full-length PVRL4 and its cytoplasmic deletion mutant reduced this effect (Figure 2E,F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that PVRL4 protects TL-HMECs from the differentiation associated with anchorage loss and promotes subsequent cellular expansion. Importantly, this phenotype is facilitated by the extracellular part of PVRL4 rather than by its intracellular region."

We sought to rule out the possibility that PVRL4-induced colonies were due to an artifact associated with either incomplete dissociation of cells prior to seeding into methylcellulose or potential de novo association of cells during growth in anchorage-independent conditions. To address this, we mixed equal numbers of dsRed- and GFP-labeled TL-HMECs expressing PVRL4 and (i) seeded them into methylcellulose or (ii) co-cultured the mixed population on an adherent surface, subsequently seeding them into methylcellulose. Examining the colors of resulting colonies revealed that out of 56 colonies from sample (i), all 56 were single-color colonies, whereas in sample (ii), 39 out of 40 colonies were single-color, and only one colony contained both GFP and dsRed-positive cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). The rarity of double-color colonies demonstrates that PVRL4-induced colonies originate from individual cells. Consistent with this observation, passing cells through a 35 μm cell strainer immediately prior to being seeded in the absence of anchorage did not affect colony numbers (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), further confirming that PVRL4-induced colonies are clonal in origin and that the observed increase in colony numbers is not a result of pre-existing multicellular clusters having a survival advantage over single cells in the absence of anchorage."

To test whether PVRL1 was necessary for PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment, we used an shRNA to stably deplete the PVRL1 transcript in a dsRed-labeled population of TL-HMECs and allowed cells to aggregate with PVRL4-expressing GFP-labeled TL-HMECs. PVRL1 depletion resulted in exclusion of dsRed-labeled cells from multicellular clusters, whereas control shRNA-expressing cells were readily incorporated (Figure 3C), suggesting that PVRL4-mediated cell–cell contacts are carried out through interaction with its receptor PVRL1."

Therefore, we sought a physical means by which to disrupt PVRL4-induced cell-to-cell attachment to examine its effects on colony formation. We asked whether antibodies directed towards the extracellular domain of PVRL4 could block PVRL4-induced cluster formation and anchorage-independent growth. Cell clustering was completely abrogated in the presence of three independent PVRL4 antibodies, whereas control IgG or a blocking antibody against E-cadherin (DECMA-1) did not produce such an effect (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Similarly, an antibody targeting the extracellular region of PVRL1 inhibited PVRL4-induced cell clustering (Figure 3—figure supplement 5). PVRL4-driven colony formation was inhibited to almost a basal level in the presence of a monoclonal antibody targeting the extracellular region of PVRL4, but no such effect was observed on colonies induced by PTEN shRNA (Figure 3F), demonstrating that the observed inhibition is due to a direct effect of an antibody and not due to its general toxicity. Our data indicate that PVRL4 enables anchorage-independent growth in a manner which is dependent on PVRL4-PVRL1-driven cell-to-cell attachment, suggesting that these intercellular contacts may be providing a survival benefit in the context of altered matrix anchorage."

To address this question, we created chimeric constructs in which extracellular regions of PVRL1 and PVRL4 were fused to the transmembrane regions of an unrelated transmembrane molecule, CD8 (Figure 4A), and the cytoplasmic regions of both molecules were deleted. We first introduced PVRL4-CD8tm into TL-HMECs, concomitantly depleting endogenous PVRL1 by RNAi (Figure 4D). Membrane localization of the chimeric construct was verified by immunofluorescence (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Expression of PVRL4-CD8tm induced both cell clustering and anchorage-independent colony formation, and both phenotypes were suppressed by stable depletion of endogenous PVRL1 (Figure 4B,C). Importantly, clustering was restored when two populations of clustering-incompetent cells, PVRL4-CD8tm expressing, PVRL1-depleted cells (PVRL4+; PVRL1−) and control cells (PVRL4−; PVRL1+), were mixed together, independently verifying that cell-to-cell attachment is mediated by the PVRL4-PVRL1 trans-interacting module (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Both cell clustering and colony formation defects induced by PVRL1 shRNA were rescued by the expression of the shRNA-resistant PVRL1-CD8tm construct. Taken together, these data indicate an on-target nature of the PVRL1 depletion phenotype and demonstrate that ability to withstand the absence of anchorage is driven by the PVRL4-PVRL1 cell-surface trans-interaction and not by intracellular or transmembrane regions of either molecule."

Along these lines, we hypothesized that other oncogenic perturbations that drive anchorage-independent growth (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) may also promote cell-to-cell attachment as a part of their survival strategy. Either expression of mutant RasV12, or myristoylated PI3K catalytic subunit (Figure 4—figure supplement 4), or shRNA-mediated depletion of PTEN (Figure 4—figure supplement 5; for depletion efficiencies see Figure 4—figure supplement 6) triggered multicellular cluster formation in TL-HMECs. None of the perturbations induced endogenous PVRL4 expression, as measured by FACS (not shown), which suggests that clustering in these cases was mediated through other adhesion mechanisms. Mixing PTEN shRNA-expressing GFP-labeled cells with control shRNA-expressing dsRed-labeled cells triggered the formation of multicellular clusters that contained both GFP- and dsRed-labeled cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 7), demonstrating that, in a manner similar to PVRL4, depletion of PTEN enabled attachment of TL-HMECs to cells that do not carry the perturbation as well as those that do. Taken together, these observations suggest that increased cell-to-cell attachment is a phenotype that multiple oncogenic perturbations converge upon."

      "content": "We next sought to gain insight into the mechanism by which PVRL4-PVRL1 cell surface trans-interaction becomes translated into survival advantage in conditions of anchorage loss. Neither of the two molecules possesses catalytic activity; in addition, our data show that transmembrane as well as cytoplasmic regions are dispensable for anchorage-independence. Therefore, we considered the possibility that the assembly of a PVRL4-PVRL1 interacting module on the interface of two neighboring cells may be triggering lateral recruitment and/or activation of cell surface-localized proteins, which, in turn, conveys a prosurvival signal. To identify potential cell surface-localized binding partners of PVRL4, we created a C-terminally HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 construct and first verified that cell–cell clustering as well as anchorage-independent growth phenotypes were not affected by the addition of a C-terminal tag (not shown). We then performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA agarose beads from lysates of TL-HMECs induced to express either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP and subjected the eluates to tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Since only the extracellular regions of PVRL4 and PVRL1 are required for anchorage-independent colony formation, we searched the list of PVRL4 IP-specific peptides for those that had at least three unique peptides corresponding to cell surface-localized proteins, as classified by Gene Ontology. We identified the transmembrane protein integrin β4 as specifically interacting with HA/FLAG-PVRL4 (Figure 5A). To validate the putative PVRL4–integrin β4 interaction directly in cells under conditions of anchorage deprivation, we performed immunoprecipitations with anti-HA beads from lysates of suspension-incubated TL-HMECs that expressed either HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 or HA/FLAG-tagged GFP. Immunoblotting for integrin β4 verified a specific association of integrin β4 with PVRL4 (Figure 5B). We next asked if the integrin β4–PVRL4 association was affected by cell clustering. The same amount of integrin β4 coprecipitated with HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 from lysates prepared from multicellular clusters and from single-cell suspension. Similarly, the amount of coprecipitating integrin β4 was not affected by RNAi-mediated depletion of PVRL1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). These data point to a cis mode of association between PVRL4 and integrin β4 on the membrane of the same cell."

Immunoprecipitation of integrin β4 from TL-HMECs which were induced to express either a full-length or a cytoplasmic deletion version of PVRL4 revealed that both full-length and mutant versions of PVRL4 coprecipitated with integrin β4, and not with a control IgG (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). This finding parallels our earlier demonstration that the cytoplasmic region of PVRL4 is dispensable for the anchorage-independence phenotype, prompting us to investigate a potential mechanistic link between integrin β4 and the PVRL4-driven anchorage-independence phenotype."

However, PVRL4-induced anchorage-independent colony formation was markedly reduced in the presence of integrin β4-specific shRNAs (Figure 5D). Importantly, reliance on integrin β4 was specific to colony growth promoted by PVRL4, as PI3K-driven colony numbers were not affected by its depletion."

In contrast to other integrins, the C-terminus of integrin β4 does not bind FAK. However, it can activate Src family kinases (SFKs) in a FAK-independent manner via recruitment of SHP-2 phosphatase."

To test whether cells in PVRL4-induced clusters are able to maintain SFK activity in conditions of anchorage loss, we measured levels of autophosphorylated SFKs in TL-HMECs after 6 hr incubation in suspension (Figure 5E). Levels of activated SFK dropped precipitously in control cells while remaining high in PVRL4-expressing cells but not in PVRL4-expressing, PVRL1-depleted cells. Moreover, the addition of anti-PVRL4 antibody also reduced the level of SFK autophosphorylation in suspension. A similar effect was observed after a short-term incubation of PVRL4-expressing TL-HMECs in suspension (Figure 5F), where levels of SFK activation observed in freshly detached cells (0 hr time point) were maintained in cells that were allowed to attach to each other but not in cells in which clustering was prevented by either anti-PVRL4 antibody or PVRL1 depletion."

Since PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth is inhibited both by integrin β4 depletion and by chemical inhibition of SFK activity, we reasoned that depletion of SHP-2 might have a similar effect. Indeed, two independent shRNAs against SHP-2 completely abrogated colony formation induced by PVRL4 (Figure 5H,I). Taken together, these data suggest that PVRL4-driven anchorage-independent growth is facilitated via activation of the integrin β4/SHP-2/Src signaling pathway in a manner that is dependent on cell-to-cell attachment."

      "content": "Having uncovered a role for PVRL4 in enabling epithelial cells to escape growth restriction associated with the lack of proper matrix anchorage, we next sought to test its involvement in driving the tumorigenic properties of breast cancer cells. We first focused on an inflammatory breast tumor cell line SUM190, which contains a particularly high-level focal amplification (∼50 kb) of the PVRL4 genomic locus (Figure 6A) (Beroukhim et al., 2010). To ask whether PVRL4 is involved in enabling anchorage-independent growth of these cells, we designed four independent shRNAs targeting PVRL4 and stably expressed them in SUM190 cells, confirming the extent of depletion by RT-qPCR (Figure 6B). Paralleling effects seen in TL-HMECs, spontaneous self-clustering of SUM190 cells was abrogated by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) or by RNAi against PVRL4 (Figure 6—figure supplement 2). Similarly, heterotypic attachment of SUM190 cells with human lung microvascular endothelial (HMVEC-L) cells was prevented by anti-PVRL4 antibodies (Figure 6—figure supplement 3) and by RNAi (Figure 6—figure supplement 4). RNAi against PVRL4 potently reduced both anchorage-independent colony formation and clonogenic growth of SUM190 cells, indicating that PVRL4 is involved in the growth and survival of breast cancer cells. Importantly, observed effects correlated with the degree of RNAi-mediated mRNA depletion (Figure 6B). To verify that the effects of PVRL4 depletion are not limited to SUM190 cells, we expressed anti-PVRL4 shRNAs in two additional breast cancer cell lines, Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 (Figure 6—figure supplement 5), which both express lower levels of PVRL4 than SUM190 cells (Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007), and observed a strong defect in clonogenic growth (Figure 6—figure supplement 6) and reduced proliferation in the absence of anchorage (Figure 6—figure supplement 7)."

      "content": "Having previously shown that blocking PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment with a monoclonal antibody suppresses SFK activation and anchorage-independent growth of TL-HMECs in vitro, we sought to determine whether this antibody would similarly inhibit SUM190 xenograft growth in an in vivo setting. To address this, we treated mice bearing ∼50 mm3 SUM190-eGFP xenografts with four consecutive intravenous injections of either anti-PVRL4 monoclonal antibody or isotype control IgG at 15 mg/kg each. After the last treatment, we continued to monitor tumor growth for the next 7 days. Whereas tumor volumes in the control group steadily increased over time, the PVRL4 antibody-treated group displayed a remarkable stalling of tumor growth throughout the course of the injection regimen (Figure 7D). Immunoblotting of tumor lysates revealed that PVRL4 antibody treatment resulted in a precipitous decline of PVRL4 protein levels, suggesting that cells with the highest expression of PVRL4 were eliminated by the treatment (Figure 7E). Dissection of excised xenografts revealed a softer, paste-like composition of PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors compared to the more solid consistency of control-treated samples. This latter observation was corroborated by histological analysis (Figure 7F), which revealed areas of widespread necrosis and, importantly, loss of cell contacts (Figure 7D–F) when compared to control IgG-treated tumors (Figure 7A–C). Finally, examination of three-dimensional tumor architecture in control- and anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated tumors by two-photon confocal microscopy revealed reduced cell–cell contacts in anti-PVRL4 antibody-treated samples as compared to controls (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). The loss of cell contacts and necrosis observed in treated tumors supports our model of PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachments conferring ability to sustain growth in conditions of matrix anchorage loss."

Specifically, we mixed SUM190 cells with fresh human NK cells and measured the relative degree of cell lysis induced by either anti-PVRL4 antibody or control IgG. No increase in cell lysis was observed with anti-PVRL4 antibody over isotype control-incubated cells, demonstrating that anti-PVRL4 antibody was unable to efficiently recruit Fc receptor-containing cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). Moreover, immunohistochemical staining of control and anti-PVRL4 IgG-treated tumor sections for a mouse macrophage-specific marker F4/80 revealed no differences in the extent of macrophage infiltration (Figure 7—figure supplement 4). Taken together, these data suggest that the observed inhibitory effect is likely to be a consequence of a direct blockade of PVRL4 function."

To address this, we measured levels of E-cadherin (an epithelial marker) and vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) in SUM190 xenografts treated with anti-PVRL4 antibody in vivo (Figure 7—figure supplement 5A) as well as in cultured SUM190 cells in which PVRL4 expression was inhibited by RNAi (Figure 7—figure supplement 5B).

Among normal mouse tissues, PVRL4 expression is strongest in cornea and skin epidermis (Wu et al., 2009). The skin surface of mice treated with anti-PVRL4 antibodies was not visibly affected by treatment, and mice appeared healthy overall, demonstrating that targeted therapy against PVRL4 does not induce acute side effects in this organism. Taken together with our findings that functionally link PVRL4 to tumorigenesis, as well as with its widespread expression in multiple tumor types, targeting PVRL4-driven cell-to-cell attachment can be viewed as a potential therapeutic strategy directed against a broad spectrum of tumor types."

PVRL4 is expressed in a limited set of normal tissues—namely, skin epidermis, hair follicles, placenta, trachea, and lung (Jelani et al., 2011)—yet it becomes overexpressed in a large fraction of breast (Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007), NSCLC (Takano et al., 2009), and ovarian (Derycke et al., 2010) tumors. Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations involving PVRL4 in 484 breast tumors indicates a low-level copy number gain in 60.3% of samples, and high-level amplification in another 7.9% of samples (Cerami et al., 2012). Moreover, PVRL4 has emerged as a strong predictor of poor postoperative survival of patients with breast and lung cancer (Takano et al., 2009; Athanassiadou et al., 2011)."

Cytoplasmic regions of nectins recruit afadin, a large scaffold protein involved in mediating intracellular signaling. Interestingly, and in contrast to PVRL4, loss of afadin has been shown to be strongly associated with poor outcome in breast cancer patients in a number of studies (Letessier et al., 2007; Fournier et al., 2011). Supporting our findings in TL-HMECs, we found that PVRL4 is required for clonogenic and anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells in vitro as well as growth of orthotopically implanted tumors in vivo. In lung cancer cells, siRNA-mediated depletion of PVRL4 was shown to negatively affect adherent growth and motility (Takano et al., 2009), highlighting the functional role of PVRL4 across multiple cancer types. Importantly, we were able to reverse the clonogenic defect by expressing a chimeric construct consisting of the extracellular region of PVRL4 fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8, independently verifying that its function is carried out via an extracellular route."

Specifically, we identify integrin β4 as a cis-interacting partner of PVRL4 and demonstrate that anchorage-independent growth driven by PVRL4 requires intact integrin β4/SHP-2/SFK signaling. An extensive array of evidence functionally links integrin β4 to breast tumorigenesis. Similarly to PVRL4, integrin β4 expression is associated with poor prognosis and a basal-like expression profile (Diaz et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2008), and targeting integrin β4 with RNAi was shown to inhibit anchorage-independent growth, invasion, and xenograft growth in breast cancer cell lines (Lipscomb et al., 2003; Bon et al., 2006). Integrin β4 is thought to exhibit a significant degree of signaling autonomy compared to other integrins, due to its atypically long C-terminus which serves as a scaffold for its downstream effectors. This signaling autonomy was convincingly demonstrated in a study utilizing chimeric constructs where extracellular and transmembrane regions of integrin β4 were substituted with those on the TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase. Dimerization of two such chimeric molecules on the cell surface by adding TrkB ligand, BDNF, was sufficient to drive SFK activation, in a manner dependent on SHP-2 phosphatase (Merdek et al., 2007). Trans-interactions of cell adhesion molecules are thought to trigger the formation of tightly packed zippers of interacting cell adhesion molecules at a cell–cell contact interface (Walmod et al., 2004). One possibility is that trans-interacting PVRL4 and PVRL1 similarly organize into zippers at sites of cell–cell contact, driving individual integrin β4 molecules into proximity sufficient for their activation. Matrix attachment-independent activation of integrin molecules may then allow sustained SHP-2/SFK signaling sufficient for counteracting the growth-restrictive consequences of anchorage loss."

Interestingly, we found that multiple oncogenic perturbations facilitate increased intercellular adhesiveness. It remains to be further elucidated whether, and through what mechanisms, the increased ability to form contacts functionally contributes to anchorage-independent growth or other tumorigenesis-associated phenotypes in each of these instances. Increased clustering has been previously associated with greater metastatic capacity (Updyke and Nicolson, 1986), raising an interesting possibility that increased cell–cell adhesiveness is a generalized mechanism that tumor cells employ as a part of their survival strategy. It is possible that while loss of cell adhesion during EMT facilitates invasiveness, it concomitantly places cells under the stress of anchorage deprivation, compromising their survival. Thus, cancer cells may need to replace the loss of homotypic cell–cell contacts with weaker heterotypic interactions capable of promoting survival in the absence of anchorage."

This is particularly relevant for PVRL4 as 100% of breast tumors from patients with two or more lymph nodes that are positive for cancer cells express PVRL4 (Athanassiadou et al., 2011). In addition, we demonstrate that PVRL4 can promote the attachment of cancer cells to other cell types. For example, SUM190 breast cancer cells readily attach to lung endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls), and inhibiting PVRL4 with RNAi or with blocking antibodies abolishes this interaction. CTC-targeted therapy is a promising new treatment possibility, and it will be of particular interest to investigate the potential role of PVRL4 in mediating these types of interactions in vivo."

      "content": "We directly tested the utility of blocking PVRL4-driven cell–cell contacts with monoclonal antibodies as a potential therapeutic strategy. In vitro, we found that such blocking antibodies suppress PVRL4-driven cellular growth and Src family kinase activation in the absence of anchorage, and in vivo, anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment potently inhibited the growth of orthotopically implanted primary tumors. Importantly, post-antibody therapy tumor samples uniformly exhibit marked downregulation of PVRL4, confirming that the observed response is target-specific and not a consequence of a non-specific antitumor effect of the antibody. In addition, we found no difference in the degree of host macrophage recruitment or in vitro ADCC induction between control IgG and anti-PVRL4 antibodies. These observations suggest that the observed tumor growth inhibition is likely due to a direct inhibition of cell-to-cell attachment mediated by PVRL4-PVRL1 binding, and not due to an Fc receptor-mediated immune response. It remains to be tested whether a stronger inhibitory effect could be achieved with an antibody that is both ADCC-competent and capable of inhibiting PVRL4-driven cell clustering."

      "content": "Even though treatment with anti-PVRL4 antibodies caused dramatic dissolution of cell–cell contacts, we observed no changes in markers of EMT in tumors from mice treated with the antibody; neither did it produce obvious deleterious effects in treated mice. These observations signify not only the potential efficacy but also the safety of the demonstrated approach. Together, these results suggest that anti-PVRL4 monoclonal antibody therapy aimed at disrupting cell–cell interactions may be a viable strategy for treating cancer."

For PVRL4 structure-function analysis, a full-length ORF (accession number BC010423, aa 1-510) or indicated fragments (Supplementary file 1C) were generated by PCR and subcloned into pQCXIN retroviral vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). PVRL4-CD8 and PVRL1-CD8 chimeric fusions were created the following way: the extracellular region of PVRL4 (accession number BC010423, aa 1-342) or PVRL1 (accession number BC113471, aa 1-354) was amplified by PCR using a reverse primer containing a sequence for a 28 aa-long transmembrane domain of the CD8A gene (accession number NM_001768, 543–626 bp), followed by a STOP codon. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the pQCXIN vector. To create an shRNA-resistant PVRL1-CD8 construct, site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the following primers: sh3ResFW 5′-CCAGGCGTCCACAGTCAAGTTGTGCAAGTCAATGACTCCATGTATG-3′ and sh3ResRV 5′-CATACATGGAGTCATTGACTTGCACAACTTGACTGTGGACGCCTGG-3′ using a QuikChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Stable RNAi-mediated depletion was performed with shRNAs expressed in either pMSCV-PM or pGIPZ vector in a miR-30 context that were either picked from the Hannon-Elledge shRNA library (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) or designed de novo (design and cloning protocol described in Paddison et al., 2004). The 21 nt sense sequences of shRNAs used in this study are listed in Supplementary file 1D. Tandem HA/FLAG-tagged PVRL4 construct was obtained by Gateway recombination of PVRL4 entry clone into C-terminal iTAP vector (provided by W Harper). For stable labeling with fluorescent markers, cells were transduced with pHAGE-dsRed and pMSCV-CMV-GFP viruses. For assaying cell clustering in the presence of oncogenes, TL-HMECs were transduced with pWZL-myr-p110-PI3K-neo or empty pWZL-neo, and pBABE-H-RASV12-puro or empty pBABE-puro. Mouse pSPORT6-PVRL4 was purchased from Open Biosystems. Retro- and lentiviral supernatants were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells following the TransIT transfection protocol (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) and harvested 48 hr later."

For anchorage-independent colony formation assays in the presence of antibodies, the following antibodies were used: normal mouse IgG (MAB004; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and mouse anti-human PVRL4 IgG2B (MAB2659; R&D Systems) at 4 μg/ml. For anchorage-independent colony formation assays in the presence of PP2 inhibitor, PP2 (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used at 10 μM final concentration. For filtering of the cell suspension, cells were passed through a nylon mesh 35 μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ). For anoikis assays, cells were seeded on ultra-low attachment dishes (Corning, Midland, MI) in reduced growth factor MEGM with 1% methylcellulose. For assays performed in 10 cm dishes, 1.4 × 105 cells were plated; for assays performed in six-well dishes, 2.0 × 104 cells per well were plated. Total ATP measurements were performed using CellTiter GLO reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol after 72 hr of growth in suspension, and luminescence values were read with a Victor X5 plate reader. For isolation of RNA or protein lysates, cell pellets were harvested after 72 hr of growth in suspension and washed with cold PBS prior to lysis."

For the BT-474 xenograft experiment, mice were implanted with a 60 d release pellet containing 0.72 mg of 17β-estradiol (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) 72 hr prior to cell injections. Tumor growth was monitored by caliper measurements. Tumors were excised after 4 wk of growth, scaled, and photographed. For the antibody treatment experiment, 15 mg/kg of anti-PVRL4 antibody or normal IgG control (R&D Systems) was injected 4 times at days 0, 1, 4, and 7. Treatment response was assessed by caliper measurements of the tumors in anesthetized mice. Mice were euthanized 15 d after treatment initiation and tumors were harvested and representative parts subjected to paraffin embedding, Western blot analysis, and direct microscopy on an inverted Olympus Multiphoton Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope using a 25× objective. Images were analyzed by the IMARIS software package."

Primary human NK cells were isolated from a fresh buffy coat using magnetic purification (EasySep Human CD56 Positive Selection Kit; STEMCELL Technologies). Cells were co-incubated at a 1:1, 1:10, and 10:1 effector-to-target cell ratio. Next, 25 µg/ml anti-PVRL4 antibody was added to the respective wells. Cells were co-incubated for 4 hr and cell-free supernatants further subjected to time-lapsed fluorescence quantification using a TECAN Infinite 200 PRO plate reader. To determine the maximal range of europium release, target cells were lysed in DELFIA lysis buffer. Levels of released europium are displayed as percentage values of maximum release determined by lysis. To control for NK cell effector functionality, the ADCC assay was performed using the hMB lymphoma model (Leskov et al., 2012) as a target cell line in the presence of 25 µg/ml of anti-CD52 antibody (alemtuzumab)."

A cDNA for PVRL4/Nectin-4 was repeatedly recovered from this screen. PVRL4 not only caused anchorage-independent growth but also caused strong aggregation of the TL-HMEC cells. They note copy number gains of the genomic region encompassing PVRL4 in some cases of human breast cancer (∼8%). Knockdown of PVRL4 decreased clonogenic survival of one breast cancer line with PVRL4 amplification in the absence of stroma and delayed tumor progression in xenografts. An antibody to PVRL4 decreased xenograft progression, apparently by preventing cell-cell adhesive contacts."

However, more analysis is needed to determine how often human breast cancers (or other cancer types) utilize the PVRL4 pathway oncogenically."

The authors state that: “Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations from 541 breast tumors identified high-level amplification of PVRL4 locus in 6.5% of samples (Cerami et al., 2012).” This website only lists samples as having gain, loss, or wild-type loci, but does not distinguish high-level amplification from single copy gain. In the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data from 650 invasive ductal breast cancers is available along with a measure of copy number. The PVRL4 copy number alterations appear to be single or low copy number gains rather than high-level amplifications. For example, in this set of tumors, HER2 and CCND1 were amplified > 4N in 9% and 3% of cases, but there are no cases that had this level of amplification of PVRL4. Moreover, while a few cases have focal gains involving PVRL4, the vast majority of gains involving this locus involve broad chromosomal regions. Thus, the evidence from copy number does not strongly support PVRL1 as a driver oncogene in most breast cancers."

      "content": "2) Of note, however, many breast cancers seem to over express PVRL4 compared to normal breast epithelium. While overexpression is not as strong evidence of pathogenetic importance, it can be an important oncogenic mechanism in some instances. In this regard, a study of PVRL4 levels by FACS (Fabre-Lafay et al. BMC Cancer 2007) showed particularly high levels in the two cell lines that the authors studied, namely SUM190 (m.f.i. 500) and SUM185 (m.f.i. 145). However, the majority of breast cancer lines had much lower levels. For example, the commonly studied breast cancer line MCF-7 had a PVRL4 m.f.i of 22. It would therefore be informative to investigate the role of PVRL4 in a cell line with this lower level of expression, both in terms of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and using xenograft to determine the effect of PVRL4 knockdown and anti-PVRL4 antibodies."

In the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data from 650 invasive ductal breast cancers is available along with a measure of copy number. The PVRL4 copy number alterations appear to be single or low copy number gains rather than high-level amplifications. For example, in this set of tumors, HER2 and CCND1 were amplified > 4N in 9% and 3% of cases, but there are no cases that had this level of amplification of PVRL4. Moreover, while a few cases have focal gains involving PVRL4, the vast majority of gains involving this locus involve broad chromosomal regions. Thus, the evidence from copy number does not strongly support PVRL1 as a driver oncogene in most breast cancers."

      "content": "We appreciate the reviewers’ insightful criticism with regard to the nature of genomic alterations to PVRL4 in human tumors. As the reviewers point out, in the 650-tumor dataset from the Oncomine database, arrayCGH data indicate that PVRL4 in tumors is affected mostly by low-level copy gains, but not by high-level amplifications that are seen for HER2 and CCND1. In agreement with the Oncomine dataset, another cancer genomic alterations database, cBioportal, which we cite in our manuscript, similarly indicates that PVRL4 is less often affected by high-level amplifications than HER2. However, we do not completely agree with the reviewers’ statement that cBioportal “does not distinguish high-level amplification from single copy gain”. Indeed, in cBioportal, an arbitrary score is assigned to indicate the amplitude of a genomic alteration that involves the gene of interest, with “0” indicating a diploid status, “1” a low-level copy gain, and “2” a high-level amplification."

To address the reviewers’ concerns, we have changed the wording we use to describe the genomic status of PVRL4 and expanded our statement on the status of PVRL4 in tumors to reflect the data more accurately: “Analysis of a publicly available dataset of copy number alterations involving PVRL4 in 484 breast tumors indicates a low-level copy number gain in 60.3% of samples, and high-level amplification in another 7.9% of samples”."

For example, transcription upregulation or protein stabilization could also play important roles in driving PVRL4 expression in 60% of breast cancers, in addition to copy number elevation."

      "content": "2) Of note, however, many breast cancers seem to over express PVRL4 compared to normal breast epithelium. While overexpression is not as strong evidence of pathogenetic importance, it can be an important oncogenic mechanism in some instances. In this regard, a study of PVRL4 levels by FACS (Fabre-Lafay et al. BMC Cancer 2007) showed particularly high levels in the two cell lines that the authors studied, namely SUM190 (m.f.i. 500) and SUM185 (m.f.i. 145). However, the majority of breast cancer lines had much lower levels. For example, the commonly studied breast cancer line MCF-7 had a PVRL4 m.f.i of 22. It would therefore be informative to investigate the role of PVRL4 in a cell line with this lower level of expression, both in terms of in vitro anchorage-independent growth and using xenograft to determine the effect of PVRL4 knockdown and anti-PVRL4 antibodies."

To address this, we tested the effect of PVRL4 depletion using two independent shRNAs in two extra breast cancer cell lines, Sk-BR-3 and BT-474 (m.f.i. of 75 and 40, respectively – thus falling into a medium range of protein expression, according to FACS analysis performed by Fabre-Lafay et al., 2007)."

We opted not to test the effect of an anti-PVRL4 antibody treatment on BT-474 xenografts due to the costs associated with performing an additional antibody experiment in mice, and focused on testing effects of RNAi-mediated depletion of PVRL4 in this line instead, as suggested. Indeed, we found that xenograft growth of BT-474 cells was markedly sensitive to PVRL4 depletion, which was similar to what we have observed with SUM190 and SUM185 cell lines. Altogether, our data indicate that tumors with high PVRL4 and those with intermediate expression of PVRL4 may be sensitive to anti-PVRL4 therapy."
