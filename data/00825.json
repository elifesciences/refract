Here we show that MYBL2, a gene within the 20q CDR, is expressed at sharply reduced levels in CD34+ cells from most MDS cases (65%; n = 26), whether or not they harbor 20q abnormalities. In a murine competitive reconstitution model, Mybl2 knockdown by RNAi to 20–30% of normal levels in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors resulted in clonal dominance of these ‘sub-haploinsufficient’ cells, which was reflected in all blood cell lineages. By 6 months post-transplantation, the reconstituted mice had developed a clonal myeloproliferative/myelodysplastic disorder originating from the cells with aberrantly reduced Mybl2 expression. We conclude that downregulation of MYBL2 activity below levels predicted by classical haploinsufficiency underlies the clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitors in a large fraction of human myeloid malignancies."

The gene, which is called MYBL2, encodes a transcription factor that helps to control the cell division cycle. Myeloid malignancy patients lacking one copy of this gene showed levels of MYBL2 expression that were less than 50% of those in healthy individuals. This suggests that additional mechanisms must be acting to reduce expression of their remaining copy of the gene. Surprisingly, MYBL2 levels were also reduced in myeloid malignancy patients who possessed two intact copies of chromosome 20, indicating that loss of a single copy represents only one mechanism to reduce MYBL2 expression, i.e., the ‘tip-of-the-iceberg’. Hence, this finding reveals a more general role for MYBL2 as it indicates that more patients are likely to be affected by altered expression of this gene."

Although the silencing of tumor suppressor genes by chromosomal deletions, point mutations, or other mechanisms is an acknowledged factor in myeloid cell transformation, the specific involvement of gene dosage is not well understood. In broadest terms, single-copy loss of a suppressor gene can be sufficient to modify gene function and promote tumorigenesis (classical haploinsufficiency), while in other tumors, the loss of two alleles is required (two-hit paradigm of Knudson) (Knudson, 1971). Recent evidence indicates that more subtle reductions in suppressor gene function may contribute importantly to myeloid malignancy (Rosenbauer et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2007), leading to the need for faithful animal models to establish that such changes are truly involved in tumorigenesis."

Notably, only heterozygous deletions have been found in studies of myeloid malignancies with loss of chromosome 20q, without any evidence of homozygous deletion or mutations of a gene within the affected region (Heinrichs et al., 2009; Huh et al., 2010). These findings implicate a gene within the 20q CDR that is essential for cell viability, but whose tumor suppressor function is strongly dose-dependent and does not follow the classical Knudson model (Knudson, 1971), which predicts biallelic gene inactivation. Instead, monoallelic loss, with or without additional epigenetic or microRNA (miRNA)-mediated downregulation of the remaining allele, may reduce gene expression levels sufficiently to promote myeloid cell transformation. Thus, we sought to identify candidate tumor suppressor genes within the 20q CDR on the basis of their reduced expression in malignant myeloid progenitor cells, as we have reported previously for CTNNA1 in myeloid malignancies with deletions of chromosome 5q (Liu et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2009)."

      "content": "We first studied the gene expression profiles of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from eight MDS cases with cytogenetically evident aberrations of chromosome 20q, as compared to CD34+ cells from normal individuals (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We found that MYBL2, which resides near the center of this region (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), was among the top-scoring genes downregulated in MDS cells compared to normal CD34+ controls. MYBL2 encodes a highly conserved transcription factor that acts as a major component of the dREAM complex, which controls the G2-to-M phase transition within the cell cycle (Korenjak et al., 2004; Lewis et al., 2004). The mean expression level of MYBL2 (39%) was less than that of normal CD34+ cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), suggesting that mechanisms beyond the deletion of one allele might affect the remaining allele. Thus, on the assumption that some MDS cases with a normal karyotype might also have reduced expression of a gene or genes within the 20q CDR, we undertook an expression analysis of CD34+ cells from 18 MDS cases with a normal karyotype and the eight cases with a 20q aberration (Supplementary file 1A), compared to CD34+ cells from four normal bone marrow samples. MYBL2 was the top-scoring gene among 108 differentially expressed genes (Figure 1A). Further analysis showed that in 17 (65%) of 26 MDS patients (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A), MYBL2 expression levels in CD34+ cells were reduced to ≤45% of normal CD34+ cells levels (mean 32.8%). These microarray data were confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis of MYBL2 expression levels in 10 MDS cases and eight normal CD34+ bone marrow samples, including four additional normal control CD34+ samples that were not part of the original microarray analysis (Figure 1B). Importantly, MYBL2 levels measured by QRT-PCR in MDS samples were highly correlated (r = 0.966) with those determined by microarray analysis (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). Hence, MYBL2 appears to be expressed at reduced levels in nearly two-thirds of MDS cases, including those with a normal karyotype, suggesting that it functions as a dose-dependent tumor suppressor gene."

      "content": "To address whether reduced levels of MYBL2 expression actively contribute to the MDS phenotype or merely constitute a compensatory response to other abnormalities, we asked if reduced MYBL2 transcriptional activity is reflected in the MDS gene expression signature. To model gene dose insufficiency by RNA interference (RNAi), we used a set of eight shRNA-expression vectors in the MDS/AML cell line SKM1, which reduced MYBL2 expression to 5–30% of the endogenous MYBL2 levels (Figure 2A), approximating the endogenous levels we had identified in CD34+ cells from patients (Figure 1B). To identify the genes most highly correlated with decreased MYBL2 expression, we introduced our shRNA-expression vectors into normal primary human CD34+ cells and measured gene expression at 48 hr post-transduction. Nearly all differentially expressed genes were downregulated after MYBL2 knockdown (81 of 89 genes; Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Because these results are based on eight different MYBL2-specific shRNAs, each with different knockdown efficiency, this analysis ensures the robustness of the data and eliminates potentially confounding off-target effects by individual shRNAs. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) identified mitosis as the key biological process reflected by the MYBL2 gene signature, specifically the G2-to-M phase transition (Figure 2—figure supplement 2) (Whitfield et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2004; Shepard et al., 2005). Individual genes and their functions included the G2 cell cycle regulator cyclin B (CCNB1 and CCNB2), the early mitotic regulator FBXO5 and the coregulator of chromosome architecture CDCA2 (Supplementary file 1B)."

MYBL2 expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR normalized to three control genes (upper panel) and by Western blotting with tubulin as a normalization control (lower panels). (B) Heat map of the top 25 genes whose expression levels positively correlated (score ≥ 0.8) with those of MYBL2. Gene expression in normal CD34+ cells was measured by microarray in one unperturbed sample (‘no shRNA’), four control shRNA-expressing samples (shRNAs A–D) and eight MYBL2-specific shRNA-expressing samples (shRNAs 1-8). (C) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the MYBL2 gene signature (top 81 positively correlated genes) within the ranked gene expression results for CD34+ cells from MDS patients, compared to CD34+ cells from normal bone marrow. Enrichment of the MYBL2 signature in MDS bone marrow cells (see Figure 1A) is apparent. Genes are ranked by score and plotted on the x-axis; hits are indicated by vertical black bars and the enrichment score is plotted in red. (D) Heat map corresponding to the GSEA showing the 25 top-scoring genes. One sample, indicated by an ‘x’, shows enrichment of the MYBL2 signature, but relatively normal MYBL2 expression suggesting a measurement problem."

Furthermore, the expression levels of MYBL2-regulated genes corresponded closely with those of MYBL2 itself (Figure 2D).

To validate our classification algorithm using a separate dataset, we then interrogated the normal karyotype cases (n = 94) reported by Pellagati et al. (Pellagatti et al., 2010), identifying a MYBL2-low signature in 36 cases (38%), most of which (30 cases) were identified at a confidence level of 1.0. 58 cases (62%) had a normal MYBL2 signature (Figure 3). Thus, we were able to confirm in an independent cohort that the ‘MYBL2 low’ signature is present in CD34+ cells from a substantial fraction of normal-karyotype MDS cases."

Both mutations, an amino acid substitution and a nonsense mutation, were located within the C-terminus. To test whether these mutations inactivate the MYBL2 protein, we replaced endogenous MYBL2 in SKM1 cells with MYBL2 carrying one of the mutations, using a knockdown/rescue approach. SKM1 cells died upon complete knockdown of MYBL2 with an shRNA targeting the 3′UTR (Figure 4B). This phenotype was rescued by re-expression of the wild-type MYBL2 cDNA and the cDNA from patient 28 (Figure 4A), but not by re-expression of the mutated, truncated MYBL2 cDNA of patient 27, which failed to restore the viability of the SKM1 cells. Thus, we have documented a somatically acquired gene-specific inactivating mutation that targets MYBL2 in one case of MDS. This specific case is highly informative because the inactivating mutation targets MYBL2 directly, and not an adjacent gene on 20q."

A potential candidate is aberrant DNA methylation, especially in view of the 921 base-pair CpG island that spans the proximal promoter and the first exon of the MYBL2 gene. However, analysis of this site using bone marrow cell DNA from 30 MDS patients failed to detect any methylated cytosines, indicating that DNA methylation is not a frequent mechanism for MYBL2 downregulation in MDS (JP Issa, personal communication, 2012). This finding is supported by a recently published study that did not identify methylation affecting the MYBL2 gene in cells from 83 MDS cases (Del Rey et al., 2012)."

We pursued this notion in a subset of patient samples (seven with low MYBL2 expression and two with normal MYBL2 expression, together with three controls) by analyzing the expression levels of mir-29a and mir-30e. Both of these miRNAs target MYBL2 (Han et al., 2010; Martinez et al., 2011), with aberrant expression of mir-29a leading to clonal dominance and acute myeloid leukemia (Han et al., 2010). Our results show upregulation of either mir-29a or mir-30e in three cases with MYBL2 downregulation, but not in controls or cases with normal MYBL2 expression (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Thus, overexpression of miRNAs targeting MYBL2 affords an attractive mechanism by which MYBL2 expression levels are lowered in a substantial fraction of MDS cases."

Thus, using five independent, specific shRNA-expressing vectors to target Mybl2 in primitive hematopoietic cells, we established a competitive reconstitution assay in mice. These vectors downregulated Mybl2 expression to levels that ranged from 13% (M1) to 33% (M5) of those expressed by control shRNA-expressing vectors in 32D cells, a murine myeloid cell line (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). After transducing Lin− mononuclear bone marrow cells in separate vials with these five vectors, which coexpressed a green fluorescent protein (GFP), or with two different control shRNA vectors coexpressing a red fluorescent protein (RFP) (Strack et al., 2008), we washed the cells, pooled the five Mybl2-specific shRNA knockdown cell aliquots and the two control aliquots, and transplanted equal numbers of these two cell pools into lethally irradiated mice (Figure 5A). A second group of mice were transplanted with pooled GFP+ and RFP+ cells expressing control shRNAs only, generating control/GFP vs control/RFP recipients (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A). Analysis of GFP and RFP levels in peripheral blood at 12 weeks (Figure 5B) showed a strikingly higher median frequency of GFP+ vs RFP+ cells in the peripheral blood of the mice reconstituted with GFP+/Mybl2-shRNA vs RFP+/control shRNA (30.9% vs 2.6%, p<0.0001). By contrast, in mice injected with control/GFP vs control/RFP cells, the median frequencies of both RFP- and GFP-expressing cells were low (1.5% and 3.4%; Figure 5—figure supplement 2B)."

For this experiment (Figure 6A) we transduced Lin− bone marrow cells with either the M3 shRNA vector (n = 7 mice) or the M4 shRNA vector (n = 8 mice). These two shRNAs were chosen because QPCR analysis of the mice injected with pools of cells transduced with each of the five shRNAs (Figure 5A) showed that M3 and M4 were integrated into the DNA of the reconstituted cells that exhibited clonal dominance (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The results of transplanting cells transduced with single Mybl2-specific hairpins clearly show clonal dominance by cells transduced with either of these vectors (Figure 6B). In a ‘color-swap’ experiment using the M3 shRNA, the bone marrow cells with Mybl2 knockdown became clonally dominant, whether the red or green fluorophore was used (Figure 6C). Together, these competitive reconstitution studies firmly establish the surprising finding that downregulation of Mybl2 levels to ∼30% of normal levels using two different Mybl2 shRNAs imparts a strong clonal advantage to hematopoietic progenitor cells, one that becomes reflected in the analysis of circulating white blood cells as early as 12 weeks after transplantation."

(C) Experiment 2, ‘color-swap’ experiment: Mybl2-specific shRNA M3 coupled with GFP (right) or RFP (left) expression associated with a significant expansion of Mybl2-downregulated cells (p=0.007 and p=0.001, respectively). (D) Flow cytometric analysis of mononuclear bone marrow cells from eight experimental mice (E6–E13) transplanted with cells expressing Mybl2-specific M3 shRNA/GFP and control shRNA/RFP cells (E6–E9) or Mybl2-specific M3 shRNA/RFP cells and control shRNA/GFP cells (E10–E13). Mybl2-RNAi cells were markedly overrepresented by comparison to results for control mice (C3, C4) transplanted with control shRNA/RFP- and shRNA/GFP-transduced cells. The fractions of GFP (green), RPF (red) and unlabeled cells (gray) are shown. (E) Analysis of bone marrow erythropoiesis by CD71/Ter119 staining with frequencies of Ter119-positive cell frequencies shown for all animals. (F) Analysis of Mybl2 levels of flow sorted cells by Western-blotting (upper panel) and qRT-PCR (lower panel)."

Lineage analysis showed that this expansion included lymphocytes as well as myeloid cells (Figure 5D–F), indicating clonal dominance originating from transduced multilineage long-term repopulating cells. Cells of the myeloid lineage were most prominently affected, as the frequency of GFP+ cells in the Gr1+/Mac1+ population exceeded 90% in three of five experimental animals. Bone marrow erythropoiesis was reduced by Mybl2 knockdown, as indicated by the decreased percentages of Ter119+ cells (Figures 5G–I and 6E; Figure 8—figure supplement 1D). As expected, analysis by Western blotting and QRT-PCR of bone marrow cells expressing the M3 Mybl2-shRNA as a single hairpin showed that Mybl2 expression levels were reduced to approximately 20–30% of control levels after long-term reconstitution (Figure 6F). We did not observe any effect of this level of Mybl2 knockdown on the cell cycle-phase distribution of bone marrow cells from mice 6–7 months post-transplantation (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), indicating that this level of decreased Mybl2 expression does not induce a delay in the G2-to-M-phase transition."

Circulating white blood cell and platelet counts were in the normal range. Spleen weight was increased in 12 of the 13 mice, reflecting extramedullary hematopoiesis. A few of the mice showed hunched posture, weight loss and lethargy at the time of euthanasia (6–7 months post-transplant), but the majority of the recipient mice appeared well with no evidence of overt hematologic disease."

(B and C) Normal spleen histology at different magnification of control mouse C1 showing normal lymphoid-rich white pulp (50% spleen volume) and red pulp (50%). About 10% of the spleen consists of extramedullary hematopoiesis, which is in the red pulp and normal for mice. (D and E) Spleen histology of mouse E1 with specific Mybl2-knockdown at different magnification shows a marked depletion of white pulp. About 90% consists of red pulp, which is almost entirely extramedullary hematopoiesis. (F–K) Normal bone marrow histology (F and G) and cytology (H) of control mouse C1, compared to corresponding results for mouse E1 with specific Mybl2-knockdown (histology I, J; cytology K).

The spleens were frequently enlarged (Figure 7A), the white pulp was virtually absent, and the whole organ showed evidence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. Notably, one mouse developed an erythroid leukemia characterized by a block of differentiation at the CD71-positive stage at 6 months post-transplantation (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). In summary, the histopathologic findings in these mice indicate a clonal myeloproliferative disorder with dysplastic features."

The picture beginning to emerge from these investigations is that a broad array of molecular changes have the potential to drive the biology and clinical phenotypes of MDS in unique ways. Yet, the disease remains very heterogeneous and none of the molecular lesions that have been convincingly linked to MDS pathogenesis affect more than a fourth of cases overall, with a prevalence of 1–15% being much more common (Bejar et al., 2011; Shih et al., 2012)."

This result is somewhat surprising given that MYBL2 has been implicated as a gene that is typically overexpressed (rather than downregulated) in several types of cancer and whose elevated expression correlates with a poor prognosis in human breast cancer and other malignancies (Amatschek et al., 2004; Paik et al., 2004). However, no direct evidence demonstrating oncogenic activity by overexpressed MYBL2 has been reported to date. High levels of expression of this transcription factor in other tumor types may reflect the greater proliferative rate of the tumor cell population compared to resting cells, so that the apparently levels of high MYBL2 activity may be a consequence rather than a cause of malignant transformation. By contrast, the proliferative fraction of cells in myeloid neoplasia is generally quite low."

      "content": "Our findings demonstrate the surprising finding that abnormally low levels of MYBL2 expression have the unique property of imparting a clonal advantage to multipotent hematopoietic progenitors, leading rapidly to the clonal dominance of such cells within the myeloid, and B- and T-lymphocyte cell lineages. The persistence of clonal dominance in recipient mice for more than 6 months after bone marrow cell transplantation, and in recipients of secondary transplants, indicates that the affected multipotent hematopoietic cells have both self-renewal and long-term repopulating ability (Morrison and Weissman, 1994). Hence, our finding establishes MYBL2 as a key tumor suppressor gene of the 20q CDR affected in human MDS and MPD. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that haploinsufficiency for other genes within the 20q CDR cooperates with aberrantly low expression of MYBL2 to move the cells toward malignant transformation, as has been shown for the CDR associated with the 5q-syndrome, where haploinsufficiency of the gene RPS14 as well as loss of expression of an miRNA (Ebert et al., 2008; Barlow et al., 2010; Starczynowski et al., 2010) are critical steps in MDS pathogenesis."

      "content": "Most intriguing is our finding of decreased MYBL2 expression in MDS cases with a normal karyotype, which suggests that interstitial deletion of chromosome 20q is not the only mechanism by which MYBL2 activity can be reduced in MDS. Indeed, low levels of MYBL2 were apparent in 10 (56%) of 18 of our normal-karyotype MDS cases, and 38% of those reported by Pellagatti et al. (Pellagatti et al., 2010). We were unable to implicate aberrant methylation of the MYBL2 genomic locus as an additional mechanism of gene-dosage reduction; instead, we found elevated expression levels of mir-29a and mir-30e, which are known to target MYBL2 (Martinez et al., 2011), in CD34+ cells from patients with MDS and low levels of MYBL2 expression. In addition, others have shown that overexpression of mir-29a in murine bone marrow cells leads to acute myeloid leukemia (Han et al., 2010). Combined with our results, this observation suggests that mir-29a may be oncogenic, at least in part, because it targets Mybl2 transcripts. Finally, we identified a case with heterozygous missense mutation in MYBL2 that led to the loss of gene function, analogous to the effect of monoallelic gene deletion. Thus, our results indicate that the MYBL2 transcription factor gene is targeted by diverse molecular events in MDS, including not only deletion within the 20q chromosomal region, but also heterozygous loss-of-function mutations and the repression of gene expression by dysregulated miRNAs."

(Clarke et al., 2012) have also described an association between MYBL2 expression levels and the occurrence of hematologic disorders, including MDS, in aged Mybl2 haploinsufficient mice. These authors were able to show that haploinsufficiency for the Mybl2 gene increases susceptibility to age-related myeloid neoplasia. Our data indicate that more pronounced gene dosage reduction of Mybl2 might be even more advantageous for clonal dominance. Although our findings do not rule out a causal role for straight-forward haploinsufficiency in myeloid malignancies, they strongly suggest that the oncogenic effects of reduced MYBL2 dosage are more pronounced as the dosage level falls to near 30% of normal, in keeping with the continuum model of tumor suppression (Berger et al., 2011). We would also stress that in the range of MYBL2 dosage reductions in this study were modeled based on those found in CD34+ cells from MDS clinical samples, in which the reductions of MYBL2 gene dosage were predominately in the range of 20–30% of normal levels, and thus were considerably lower than the 50% predicted by classical haploinsufficiency. Importantly, expression levels lower than 20% appear incompatible with cell growth (Figure 4B), consistent with the known function of MYBL2 as a key regulator of G2-to-M transition and the fact that biallelic inactivation of this gene causes early embryonic lethality in the mouse due to a block in inner cell mass formation during embryonic development (Tanaka et al., 1999)."

Raw data were processed in Expression Console (Affymetrix) using RMA normalization. Expression values for each gene were annotated by mapping all probe sets to the human genome version hg19. Data complexity was reduced to one canonical transcript per gene, resulting in a single identifier per gene (17,982 total). The expression data were processed in Gene Pattern (Reich et al., 2006) (Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA). Non-expressed genes were filtered out, and the resulting expression matrix was analyzed with the comparative marker module (two class comparison with 10,000 permutations) or the gene neighbor module in Gene Pattern. GSEA (Broad Institute) was performed as described previously (Subramanian et al., 2005). Data are available at Gene Expression Omnibus, accession number GSE43401."
