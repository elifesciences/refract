      "content": "Breast cancer genomes have revealed a novel form of mutation showers (kataegis) in which multiple same-strand substitutions at C:G pairs spaced one to several hundred nucleotides apart are clustered over kilobase-sized regions, often associated with sites of DNA rearrangement. We show kataegis can result from AID/APOBEC-catalysed cytidine deamination in the vicinity of DNA breaks, likely through action on single-stranded DNA exposed during resection. Cancer-like kataegis can be recapitulated by expression of AID/APOBEC family deaminases in yeast where it largely depends on uracil excision, which generates an abasic site for strand breakage. Localized kataegis can also be nucleated by an I-SceI-induced break. Genome-wide patterns of APOBEC3-catalyzed deamination in yeast reveal APOBEC3B and 3A as the deaminases whose mutational signatures are most similar to those of breast cancer kataegic mutations. Together with expression and functional assays, the results implicate APOBEC3B/A in breast cancer hypermutation and give insight into the mechanism of kataegis."

By comparing the mutations induced in the yeast cells with those observed in breast cancer cells, Taylor et al. identified APOBEC3B as the enzyme most likely to be responsible for kataegis in breast cancer (with APOBEC3A also a strong candidate in some cancers). Moreover, they showed that APOBEC3B was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines, and that APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A can also cause DNA damage in human cells."

Although the mechanism underlying kataegis is unknown, the fact that the mutations occurred nearly exclusively at C residues preceded by a 5′-T suggested that AID/APOBEC cytidine-DNA deaminases might possibly be involved in the process since these enzymes are sensitive to the 5′-flanking sequence context (Conticello et al., 2007; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012)."

      "content": "Members of the AID/APOBEC family of enzymes (reviewed in Conticello et al., 2007) deaminate cytosine in the context of a single-stranded polynucleotide substrate, and function in adaptive and innate immunity. AID acts on C residues in the DNA of the genomic immunoglobulin loci in activated lymphocytes to trigger antibody gene diversification whereas APOBEC3 family members, of which there are seven in humans, act on C residues in the DNA of viral replication intermediates (usually in the cytoplasm) as part of a host restriction pathway. Off-target deamination by AID results in nucleotide substitutions and genomic rearrangements in B lymphocyte tumours, some of which are implicated in oncogenesis (reviewed by Gazumyan et al., 2012). Although AID is the only member of the AID/APOBEC family known to act physiologically on endogenous nuclear DNA, it is possible that other members of the AID/APOBEC family might occasionally get access to the nucleus and cause cancer-associated genomic damage or mutation (Harris et al., 2002; Beale et al., 2004; Vartanian et al., 2008; Stenglein et al., 2010; Landry et al., 2011; Nik-Zainal et al., 2012; Nowarski et al., 2012)."

Genome sequencing, however, revealed that most CanR colonies had typically accumulated less than 10 point mutations (>98% at C:G pairs) during the period of AID/APOBEC induction and clonal expansion (Figure 1A). A hyperactive mutant of AID (AID*; Wang et al., 2009) gave a significantly higher mutation load (median of 25 mutations per genome). We therefore initially focused on the mutations in AID*-transformants (1078 mutations in total, of which all except 14 were at C:G pairs) to see if there were signs of kataegis."

While the median overall intermutational distance (IMD) is 13 kb, it is apparent that rather than the mutations being scattered randomly over the genome, mutation distribution is bimodal (Figure 1C). Dividing the mutations into two groups using k-means cluster analysis (Hartigan and Wong, 1979) reveals that one group exhibit a median IMD of 156 kb with a distribution of distances that is as expected for a set of individual mutations randomly scattered over the yeast genome as judged by Monte Carlo simulation (Figure 1C). We designate these as singlet mutations: they account for 52% of the total mutations. The remaining 48% of the mutations are much more closely spaced than would be expected on a random basis. We designate these as proximal mutations, which are separated from each other by a median IMD of only 727 bp with >99% of them being within 8.5 kb of their closest neighbour."

Thus, if we define proximal mutations as a pair of mutations that are located <8.5 kb apart (a distance that excludes 99% of the singlet mutations) and define a cluster as a stretch of DNA containing ≥5 proximal mutations, we find that 75% of the AID*-induced proximal mutations are actually parts of clusters. These clusters typically extend over 6–15 kb (with the full range detected being 1.8–30 kb) and contain anything up to 26 mutations (Figure 1E). This clustering is far in excess of anything that would be expected on a random basis. The level of mutation clustering observed with AID* is such that more than one-third of the transformants analysed (16/40) contain at least one mutation cluster. In affected clones, a quarter to two-thirds of all the mutations in the cell are concentrated in a small number of clusters that account for <0.2% of the entire genome. Similar clusters were also observed in yeast cells transformed with APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B as well as with the hyperactive APOBEC3G mutant APOBEC3G* (Figure 1D,F). Like the cancer kataegis, the clustered mutations in the various yeast transformants showed a strong tendency towards strand polarity; mutations within a cluster occur predominantly at either a C residue or a G residue with over 88% of mutations being strand coordinated (Figure 1D,F)."

The transversions exhibit a strong (4- to 10-fold) bias for C→G rather than C→A substitutions (Table 1) suggesting that the replication over the abasic site could be catalysed by REV1 since this translesion polymerase (by virtue of its deoxycytidyl nucleotide transferase activity) inserts C opposite abasic sites (Nelson et al., 1996). Indeed, deficiency in either REV1 or UNG led to a dramatic fall in the proportion of transversion mutations (Table 1). Deficiency in UNG also resulted in a fourfold increase in the average total mutation load in AID* transformants (Supplementary file 1B). This presumably reflects diminished repair of the AID/APOBEC-generated uracils. There was an overall decrease in average total mutation load in AID* transformants of REV1 deficient yeast that might reflect the possible non-catalytic roles of REV1 during DNA damage repair (Sale et al., 2012)."

We found that the increased mutation load in AID* ung1Δ transformants was accompanied by a dramatic shift away from mutational clustering (Figure 2B). Despite the fourfold ‘increase’ in mutation load, the percentage of mutations that are <8.5 kb from their neighbour (proximal mutations) actually ‘falls’ from accounting for 48% of the AID* mutations in wild type cells to 18% in ung1Δ transformants. Similarly, using the same criterion to distinguish clustered mutations in both datasets (≥5 linked mutations separated from their neighbour by <8.5 kb), 274 of the 1064 mutations observed in AID* wild type transformants are found within clusters compared to 28 of the 2088 mutations in the AID* ung1Δ transformants (Supplementary file 1B). Thus, the median overall IMD actually ‘increases’ from 13 kb in AID* wild type transformants to 41 kb in the ung1Δ cells despite the increase in mutation load."

Thus, it is evident that kataegis is substantially reduced in the UNG-deficient background, but not completely lost: a few residual clusters (which exhibit evident strand polarity or bipolarity) are still detected (Figure 2C)."

      "content": "The sensitivity of kataegis to UNG-deficiency indicates that kataegis is, at least in part, triggered through the generation of abasic sites. Cleavage at abasic sites by apyrimidinic endonucleases will lead to occasional double-stranded DNA breaks: kataegis could result from AID/APOBEC deamination of single-stranded DNA exposed during the resection phase of break repair. To determine whether the DNA break repair process predispose to kataegis, we introduced a target site for the restriction endonuclease I-SceI immediately downstream of the polyadenylation site of the CAN1 locus, and asked whether co-expression of I-SceI together with the APOBEC3G* deaminase increased the likelihood of kataegis in the vicinity. We chose to use APOBEC3G* for this experiment since it gave a good mutation load but a lower proportion of kataegic mutations than AID* (Supplementary file 1B): any enhancement of kataegis would therefore be more readily detectable. Consistent with previous findings (Poltoratsky et al., 2010), induction of I-SceI expression resulted in an increased frequency of deaminase-dependent selectable mutation at the linked CAN1 locus (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). More importantly, in the presence of APOBEC3G*, induction of a double-strand break increases the probability that mutations in its vicinity are kataegic (Figure 2D)."

Most of the cancers identifiable by rainfall plots as harbouring major regions of kataegis also contain clusters comprising smaller numbers of same-strand nucleotide substitutions at 5′-T-C dinucleotides (Figure 3—figure supplements 2–4). There is some diversity amongst the breast cancers with respect to the frequency/nature of the kataegic stretches. The main outlier is tumour PD4107a which carries a dense array of highly mutated (and transition-restricted) kataegic clusters coincident with extensive genomic rearrangement in a 14 Mb region of chromosome 6 (Nik-Zainal et al., 2012). Overall, the kataegic clusters in the breast cancers are distributed over a similar range of lengths to those detected in the yeast transformants (Figure 3A) but the yeast clusters do typically contain a twofold to fivefold lower density of mutations (a mean inter-mutational distance of 1220 bp within the AID* yeast kataegic stretches compared to 209 bp in PD4107a, 335 bp in PD4103a and 763 bp in PD4199a)."

Their flanking sequence preferences (reviewed in Conticello et al., 2007) are either radically different (e.g., AID prefers A/G at −1; APOBEC3G prefers C at −1) or else they do not show the high (>90%) preference for T at −1 coupled to a relative indifference to the base at −2."

With regard to APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B, the results reveal that (consistent with earlier studies on APOBEC3B; Bishop et al., 2004), both enzymes strongly prefer a T at position −1 (91%). However, the yeast studies reveal that unlike other deaminases, both APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B show mild discrimination with regard to the bases located at position −2 (APOBEC3A, A:C:G:T = 25:26:7:42; APOBEC3B, A:C:G:T = 35:14:20:31) (Figure 3B)."

Consistent with studies in other cell-types (Madsen et al., 1999; Koning et al., 2009; Stenglein et al., 2010), the expression of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B in some of the breast cancer cell-lines could be enhanced by treatment with phorbol ester or interferon alpha."

The lengths of the kataegic stretches (mostly in the range 6–15 kb) are in the same order as the extent of resection observed during yeast DNA break repair (reviewed in Paull, 2010) although the occurrence and detection of kataegis is likely to bias towards longer stretches. The distances separating adjacent mutations within the yeast kataegic stretches (averaging about 1.2 kb in the AID* dataset) might in part reflect that the deaminase both jumps and slides on ssDNA, acting with possibly low efficiency at each encountered cytidine as proposed by Goodman (Chelico et al., 2006)."

In our experiments, the signatures of the mutations associated with the I-SceI break (see Figure 2D legend) implicate APOBEC3 activity rather than error-prone polymerases as the source of mutations during the double-strand break repair. More recently Gordenin and colleagues have shown that extensive clusters of mutations can be induced in yeast by alkylating agents acting on single-stranded DNA (Roberts et al., 2012). Thus, the AID/APOBEC-mediated kataegic hypermutation, driven by these endogenous mutagens, can be viewed as a specialised, albeit dramatic, example of localised hypermutation caused by exposure of single-stranded DNA during homologous recombination, along the lines proposed by Roberts (Roberts et al., 2012)."

The reason for this is a matter for speculation but we suspect the singlet uracils largely encounter UNG as part of the base-excision repair process (which would be non-mutagenic); the C→T transition mutations would be the result of direct replication over the non-excised uracil. In contrast, the action of UNG on uracil in a stretch of exposed single-stranded DNA may yield an abasic site that is replicated over by a translesion polymerase rather than repaired."

The same likely holds true for the breast cancer kataegis. However, there is no reason why kataegis should be restricted to such initiating triggers. One can well imagine that other processes that cause significant exposure of single-stranded DNA (e.g., DNA spooling caused by replication fork stalling [Lopes et al., 2006]; R-loop structures generated during transcription of suitable target sequences [Aguilera and Gómez-González, 2008]) could predispose to kataegis. Such mechanisms, or spontaneously-arising DNA breaks, could underlie the presence of kataegis in UNG-deficient cells (this work and Lada et al., 2012). A more extensive study of the genetic dependence of kataegis and of the localisation of the kataegic stretches in yeast may give insight into such possibilities."

It also appears that those cancers which harbour kataegic stretches comprising larger numbers of mutations additionally contain multiple clusters with smaller numbers of T-C mutations (Figure 3—figure supplements 2–4). The marked bias towards a 5′-T seen amongst some cancer singlet C mutations suggests that kataegis might be signalling a much wider implication of APOBEC-mediated deamination in genome-wide mutagenesis in some tumours."

The implication of APOBEC3A fits with data from others revealing that enforced expression of APOBEC3A (as well as APOBEC3C and 3H) can lead to mutation of human papilloma viral DNA (Vartanian et al., 2008) as well as of transfected plasmid DNA (Stenglein et al., 2010). Enforced expression of APOBEC3A has also been shown to lead to genomic damage in the nucleus (Landry et al., 2011). The target-specificity data implicating APOBEC3B in the breast cancer mutation is not only supported by our demonstration that its enforced expression can yield DNA damage but also by the fact that it is well expressed in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, after submission of this manuscript, Burns et al., have demonstrated that APOBEC3B expression also correlates with a T-C mutator phenotype in many primary breast cancer tumours (Burns et al., 2013)."

With regard specifically to kataegis, given that double strand breaks are a common feature of tumour development, it will obviously be interesting to discover whether whole genome sequencing of other tumour types also reveals evidence of kataegic hypermutation and whether, in light of the fact that the AID/APOBEC family has undergone considerable expansion in primates, such kataegic hypermutation might also have contributed more generally to recent genome evolution."

The CAN1::KanMX-ISceIRS strain was generated by inserting a 1.4-kb module containing the I-SceI-recognition site and the KanMX selection cassette (Wach et al., 1994) immediately after its poly-A site by homologous recombination. Correct integration of the targeting constructs was confirmed by PCR."

Colonies were counted after 3 days growth. For I-SceI-break induction, individual colonies were grown overnight in glucose medium before dilution 1:10 into raffinose-containing medium. After 4 hr growth, galactose was added to 2% and cells were cultured for a further 2 days before serial dilution and plating as above. APOBEC3G* was used in the I-SceI experiments as it gave a good mutation load but a lower proportion of kataegic mutations than AID* (Supplementary file 1B). Induction of protein expression both with and without the raffinose step gave similar mutation rates."

For all the yeast analysis, the IMD threshold was set using the combined dataset of mutations from the wild type transformants. For the breast cancer analysis, IMDs combined from all tumours were used for threshold setting (except PD4120 because of its much higher mutation load). A cluster was called when a minimum of 5 adjacent mutations were identified each with IMDs below the threshold. This 5 mutation threshold was chosen since such clusters are likely to arise with a probability of <0.001 by randomly scattered mutations."
