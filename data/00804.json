Gem1, which is already known to regulate other aspects of the interaction between the ER and mitochondria (Kornmann et al., 2011), contains two domains that bind calcium ions and two domains that break down GTP molecules (which are closely related to the ATP molecules used by mitochondria to store chemical energy)."

The mitochondria also went on to divide successfully in both types of yeast, but both daughter mitochondria remained stuck to the ER in the mutant yeast cells (Figure 1). This suggests that Gem1 is required to disengage or mobilize ER–mitochondria contacts, which is important for the proper distribution of mitochondria in cells."

(B) The mitochondrion undergoes constriction at this contact site, which allows a helix of Dnm1 (red) to form around it. (C) This helix leads to further constriction and, ultimately, to the division of the mitochondrion and the formation of two daughter mitochondria in wild-type cells (left). Each daughter mitochondrion has its own nucleoid. Significantly, one daughter remains attached to the ER via ERMES, which remains intact through the division process. However, in cells lacking Gem1, both of the daughter mitochondria remain tethered to the same ER segment, and both have somewhat unusual shapes (right)."

Before division occurred these nucleoids were seen to exhibit behaviour that is indicative of DNA replication taking place, and after division they were mostly observed at the tips of both of the new daughter mitochondria. The contact sites between the ER and mitochondria thus appear to preferentially form near replicating nucleoids in order to assist with the distribution of DNA between the daughter mitochondria (Figure 1)."

Murley et al. demonstrate that the GTPase activity of this protein, but not its calcium-binding activity, is required for the final release of ER–mitochondria contacts, which is consistent with the results of mitochondrial inheritance studies (Koshiba et al., 2011). It has been suggested that ERMES components link the nucleoids to the cellular cytoskeleton (Boldogh et al., 2003). This notion is compatible with the results of experiments which found that the enzymes Miro1 and 2—which are similar to Gem1 in many ways—mobilize mitochondria in mammalian cells by interacting with components of the cytoskeleton (Glater et al., 2006). Gem1 could thus be involved in the recruitment of protein motility factors that promote the spatial separation of the daughter mitochondria following the division process. Alternatively, Gem1 might act directly on ERMES to regulate the physical link between the ER and mitochondria. Consistent with this idea, Miro1 localizes to ER-mitochondria contact sites in mammalian cells, and Gem1 associates with ERMES subunits and regulates the number and size of ERMES foci in yeast (Kornmann et al., 2011)."

First, does the ER facilitate constriction and, if so, how? One possibility is that an exchange of lipids at the ER–mitochondria interface alters the content of the mitochondrial membrane in this specific region, and that this leads to the constriction required for Dnm1 helix formation. Alternatively, ERMES (or its as yet unidentified mammalian equivalent) may facilitate the generation of a constricting force via actin polymerization (Korobova et al., 2013). And how is Dnm1 recruited to the constriction? Possibilities include via the ERMES complex itself or via some component of the ER that we don’t yet know about. Or maybe the curvature of the membrane activates the proteins that help to recruit the Dnm1/Drp1 enzymes that form the helix around the constriction."
