Classically, it has been presumed that the olfactory placode forms all olfactory sensory neurons. In contrast, we show that the cranial neural crest is the primary source of microvillous sensory neurons within the olfactory epithelium of zebrafish embryos. Using photoconversion-based fate mapping and live cell tracking coupled with laser ablation, we followed neural crest precursors as they migrated from the neural tube to the nasal cavity. A subset that coexpressed Sox10 protein and a neurogenin1 reporter ingressed into the olfactory epithelium and differentiated into microvillous sensory neurons. Timed loss-of-function analysis revealed a critical role for Sox10 in microvillous neurogenesis. Taken together, these findings directly demonstrate a heretofore unknown contribution of the cranial neural crest to olfactory sensory neurons in zebrafish and provide important insights into the assembly of the nascent olfactory system."

The role of the neurons in the sensory organs (the eyes, ears, and nose) is to sense stimuli—including light, sound, and odor—and transmit this sensory information to the neurons of the central nervous system for processing. The first step in sensing an odor relies on the peripheral nerves of the olfactory epithelium. This tissue, which lines the inside of the nasal cavity, includes two main types of olfactory sensory neurons: ciliated sensory neurons that detect volatile or easily evaporated substances and microvillous sensory neurons that detect pheromones, nucleotides, and/or amino acids."

      "content": "During vertebrate embryogenesis, an embryo develops three distinct germ layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm, each of which gives rise to the different tissues of the body. The ectoderm has three parts—the external ectoderm, the neural crest, and the neural tube—and together they give rise to the neurons of the peripheral and central nervous systems. The neurons within the eye and ear are known to originate from a thickened portion of the ectoderm, and it has been proposed that olfactory neurons develop in a similar manner."

By studying the development of the olfactory system in zebrafish, Saxena et al. discovered that microvillous neurons, but not ciliated neurons, develop from neural crest cells, and that the transcription factor Sox10 is critical for the development of microvillous neurons. By establishing that neural crest cells are involved in the development of a substantial proportion of olfactory sensory neurons, this work sets the stage for future studies of olfactory nerve growth and regeneration. It may also assist researchers working on anosmia (the inability to smell)."

In contrast, far less is known about initial development of the olfactory epithelium during embryogenesis. This knowledge is critical for understanding not only disorders such as anosmia—the loss of smell—but also for clarifying the remarkable ability of the olfactory epithelium to regenerate neurons in adult organisms (Graziadei and Graziadei, 1979; Bermingham-McDonogh and Reh, 2011). In addition to providing critical clues for comprehending de novo differentiation of nascent stem cells into olfactory neurons, studies of olfactogenesis may offer mechanistic insights into neurogenesis as a whole."

      "content": "The peripheral nervous system of the vertebrate head is derived from two sources: cranial ectodermal placodes and neural crest cells. Whereas placodes form the sense organs (nose, ears, and lens) of the head and contribute to neuronal portions of cranial ganglia, the glia are solely neural crest derived (Northcutt and Gans, 1983; Baker and Bronner-Fraser, 2001; Barraud et al., 2010). Sensory neurons are the primary functional players of the olfactory epithelium and have long been thought to be similar to neurons of the ear or eye. The latter arise within the developing sensory structures, the otic placode and neural retina, respectively. By analogy, the olfactory epithelium arises from the olfactory placode, a swathe of thickened ectoderm that initially resides within the anteriormost portion of the neural tube and subsequently moves laterally within the plane of the ectoderm. These cells invaginate to form the olfactory vesicle, which in turn becomes encapsulated by neural crest cells that form the surrounding nasal capsule (Osumi-Yamashita et al., 1994; Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999)."

Within the olfactory epithelium, there are two predominant types of olfactory sensory neurons: ciliated and microvillous neurons. These differ in roles, receptors, location, and patterns of innervation. Whereas more basally located ciliated sensory neurons detect volatile odorants, more apically located microvillous sensory neurons can detect pheromones, nucleotides, and/or amino acids, depending on the species (Buck, 2000; Sato and Suzuki, 2001; Hansen and Zielinski, 2005)."

      "content": "The possible role of the neural crest in development of olfactory-related derivatives has been the subject of vigorous debate. Recent literature demonstrates that olfactory ensheathing glia, nonneuronal supporting cells previously assumed to derive from the olfactory epithelium, are actually neural crest derived (Barraud et al., 2010). These findings are consistent with the neural crest origin of all other peripheral glia (Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008). In neuronal lineages, there has been considerable controversy over the cell type of origin. As one example, some studies (Whitlock et al., 2003; Forni et al., 2011) have suggested that neural crest cells give rise to GnRH cells of the terminal nerve, which is close to though not part of the olfactory nerve and epithelium. However, many other studies refute this notion and support a placodal origin for GnRH cells (Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989; Wray et al., 1989; Dubois et al., 2002; Palevitch et al., 2007; Metz and Wray, 2010; Sabado et al., 2012). Within the olfactory epithelium itself, Harden et al. (2012) recently examined the interactions of Sox10:eGFP-positive cells with six4b:mCherry-expressing placodal precursors in zebrafish. The authors interpreted their negative results to indicate a lack of contribution of neural crest cells to the olfactory epithelium. However, using the same Sox10:eGFP line, here we definitively demonstrate the neural crest origin of microvillous neurons within the olfactory epithelium."

Interestingly, we find that neural crest gives rise to microvillous, but not ciliated, sensory neurons in the developing olfactory epithelium. Specifically, we demonstrate that a neurogenin1 (Ngn1) reporter and Sox10 protein are expressed in the subset of neural crest-derived nasal cavity cells that undergo dynamic ingression into the olfactory epithelium to form microvillous neurons. If the neural crest is ablated, the olfactory epithelium cannot compensate for the loss of microvillous neurons. Finally, we show that the neural crest specifier gene Sox10 is required for microvillous neurogenesis as these cells are ingressing into the olfactory epithelium. These results definitively demonstrate for the first time a Sox10-dependent neural crest origin for microvillous sensory neurons that take residence within the placode-derived olfactory epithelium."

Visualization and analysis with Imaris software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) demonstrated that cranial neural crest cells moved anteriorly from the dorsal neural tube toward the future location of the olfactory pit. Some neural crest cells migrated and coalesced as a cup-like structure around the olfactory vesicle (Figure 1A,B) to form the mesenchymal nasal cavity, consistent with descriptions in mouse, chick, and medaka (Langille and Hall, 1988; Osumi-Yamashita et al., 1994; Le Douarin and Kalcheim, 1999)."

(E)–(J) Selected time point and z-plane excerpts from full z stacks are shown from ∼29 hpf (C) to ∼33 hpf (D) and are 40' apart; z = 17.5 μm (consisting of five 3.5 μm slices). Arrowheads indicate two ingressing cells, one from the top and the other directly behind the olfactory epithelium. All ingressing cells express Ngn1:nRFP (F, inset arrowhead). Sox10:eGFP, green; Ngn1:nRFP, red. (K) At 53 hpf, all Sox10:eGFP+ cells in the olfactory epithelium are TRPC2:Venus+ microvillous neurons. (because eGFP signal bleeds into the Venus channel, overlap was confirmed via image processing; see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Only a small number of microvillous neurons are not Sox10:eGFP+ (arrowheads). A single 3.5-μm-thick z-plane slice of the boxed area more clearly shows colocalization.

The results show that all of the Sox10:eGFP-positive cells within the olfactory epithelium are microvillous neurons, as revealed by their TRPC2:Venus expression and apical position (Figure 1K and Figure 1—figure supplement 1). In contrast, none are OMP:RFP-positive ciliated neurons (data not shown). A small number of microvillous neurons are Sox10:eGFP-negative (Figure 1K and Figure 1—figure Supplement 1, arrowheads), raising the possibility that a minor subset of these cells has a separate origin. To further confirm that the ingressed cells are neurons, we performed immunostaining with an antibody against HuC/D, a marker for newly born post-mitotic neurons (Kim et al., 1996), which colocalized in the apically located Sox10:eGFP-positive neurons (Figure 1—figure supplement 2)."

In addition, Ngn1 is expressed in neural crest cells that become sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia in zebrafish (McGraw et al., 2008). Using a Ngn1:nRFP transgenic line (Blader et al., 2003) that has been well-characterized as representative of endogenous Ngn1 expression (Blader et al., 2003, 2004; Madelaine et al., 2011), we noted Ngn1:nRFP expression in a subset of Sox10:eGFP-positive cells in the nasal cavity (Figure 1B). Interestingly, only cells that upregulate Sox10:eGFP and coexpress Ngn1:nRFP ingress into the olfactory epithelium to differentiate into microvillous neurons (Figure 1F)."

To substantiate our real-time confocal imaging, we followed the migration and differentiation of small groups of neural crest cells by making use of the PhOTO-N transgenic zebrafish line (Dempsey et al., 2012) expressing a nuclear localized version of the highly stable photoconvertible (green to red) protein Dendra2 (Gurskaya et al., 2006). By crossing this line to Sox10:eGFP fish (Figure 2A), we were able to photoconvert small numbers of neural crest cells (Figure 2B,B'), ensuring specificity of labeling. We then followed their movement from the neural rod to the nasal cavity. For some experiments, large blocks of cells (Figure 2C,C') were photoconverted to achieve broad coverage and identify all possible neural crest contributions. In both cases, all photoconversion was performed between 14 hpf (10-somite stage) and 16 hpf (14-somite stage), always unilaterally."

(B)–(C') Representative example z-planes show unilateral photoconversion of a few cells (B and B') or a large number of cells (C and C'). (B and C) show ubiquitous Dendra2 (low level green) and Sox10:eGFP (bright green), and (B' and C') show photoconverted Dendra2 (red). (D) Photoconverted cells are visible in the contralateral nasal cavity at 29 hpf; (E and E') show a 2.5-μm-thick z-plane slice of the boxed area with photoconverted cells (red, arrowheads). (F and F') At 55 hpf, photoconversion of a small number of cells (B and B') results in a subset of Sox10:eGFP+ microvillous neurons being labeled by photoconverted Dendra2 on the contralateral side.

At 29 hpf, a few photoconverted cells were present in the nasal cavity (Figure 2D–E'). At 55 hpf, by which time ingression/differentiation was nearly complete, photoconverted neural crest cells had differentiated into apically localized microvillous neurons. These results are consistent across embryos having either ‘small' or ‘large' numbers of photoconverted cells (Figure 2F–G'). In contrast, no photoconverted cells differentiate into the basally located ciliated neurons, consistent with their placodal origin and confirming the specificity of our labeling. Interestingly, many labeled neural crest cells cross the midline and migrate to the contralateral side (shown in Figure 2) where they differentiate into microvillous neurons. The small subset of microvillous neurons that are not Sox10:eGFP-positive show no overlap with the photoconverted Dendra2Red (Figure 2—figure supplement 1)."

These manipulations left cells in the olfactory epithelium untouched. By 35 hpf, both the small (Figure 3C) and large (Figure 3D) ablations of Ngn1:nRFP-positive cells in the right-side nasal cavity had highly deleterious effects on the subsequent number of microvillous neurons. By comparison, the unablated left-side nasal cavity and olfactory epithelium appeared normal. Large ablations often produced a striking phenotype with the near-complete absence of microvillous neurogenesis post-ablation (Figure 3D), whereas placode-derived ciliated neurons (Sox10:eGFP negative and Ngn1:nRFP positive in olfactory epithelium) continued to form. Ablations of Ngn1:nRFP-negative nasal cavity cells had a minor phenotype (data not shown), which may be due to the fact that some ablated cells were destined to turn on Ngn1 but were not yet expressing Ngn1:nRFP at detectable levels."

To test this hypothesis, we performed loss-of-function analysis with a morpholino that has been well characterized as specifically blocking Sox10 protein production (Dutton et al., 2001a, 2001b; Prasad et al., 2011; Whitlock et al., 2005). After morpholino injection, olfactory development was followed via real-time confocal imaging of transgenic lines."

Neighboring ciliated neurons, in contrast, develop with only mild disruption (Figure 5B,C,E,F), suggesting that downregulation of Sox10 protein specifically affects formation of microvillous neurons. This phenotype was apparent as early as 29 hpf (Figure 5A–C') and remained consistent at 33 hpf, 55 hpf, and beyond (Figure 5D–H and Figure 5–figure supplement 1). By 55 hpf, ciliated neurons were present in robust numbers comparable to those in the control embryos, while microvillous neurons remained scarce and those that did form appeared disorganized. Furthermore, the few remaining microvillous neurons were often TRPC2:Venus positive but Sox10:eGFP negative (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), suggesting that they were likely the small proportion of microvillous neurons not derived from the neural crest."

(B)–(C') Embryos with mild and moderate phenotypes (assayed histologically) display only slight changes in ciliated neurons, whereas microvillous neurons are significantly decreased in number and organization. (D)–(F') Similar results are seen at 33 hpf, with almost no Sox10:eGFP+ (green) cells becoming microvillous (blue) neurons. Ciliated (red) neurons remain relatively unaffected. (G) and (H) Antibody staining with anti-GFP against TRPC2:Venus in fixed embryos demonstrates a persistent decrease in the number of microvillous cells and disorganization at 60 hpf in Sox10 morpholino-treated embryos (H) in comparison to control embryos (G). All images were captured at identical settings to facilitate direct comparison of control and experimental embryos. (I)–(K) All embryos (I) were divided into ‘high pigmentation' (J) or ‘low pigmentation' (K) to roughly correlate Sox10 levels (higher and lower, respectively) with degree of olfactory phenotype. As expected, all control morpholino-treated embryos have high pigmentation, and all Sox10 morpholino-treated embryos with high pigmentation have only a mild phenotype. In all cases (J and K), Sox10 morpholino treatment results in most embryos having either no microvillous neurons or a decreased number. Ratios correlate with degrees of pigmentation and phenotype. (A–C', G, and H) TRPC2:Venus: green; OMP:RFP: red. (D–F') Sox10:eGFP: green; OMP:RFP: red; TRPC2:Venus: blue. Orientation arrows: D: dorsal; V: ventral; L: lateral. Scale bars: 50 μm. *p<0.001.

We were able to use this decrease in pigmentation as a surrogate marker for the degree of Sox10 knockdown. All assayed embryos (Figure 5I) were scored as ‘high pigmentation' (Figure 5J) or ‘low pigmentation' (Figure 5K) and then further separated into ‘mild', ‘moderate', or ‘severe' morphological phenotypes. Surprisingly, microvillous neuron reduction is a consistent and common feature across all categories after knockdown of Sox10. These data suggest that microvillous neuron formation is exquisitely sensitive to reductions in Sox10 protein levels, whereas other Sox10-dependent processes such as pigmentation may be more resilient."

To determine if Sox10 is required specifically during microvillous neurogenesis, as opposed to only during its well-established earlier role in neural crest specification/migration, we took advantage of a new photocleavable morpholino system (Gene Tools, LLC; Tallafuss et al., 2012). First, using a second translation-blocking antisense morpholino targeting Sox10 (previously used in Dutton et al., 2001a), we confirmed our previous results that Sox10 was necessary for microvillous neuron formation (data not shown). We then utilized a sense photo-morpholino specifically targeted to the second antisense morpholino and containing a photocleavable moiety. Coinjection of the two oligonucleotides sequestered the antisense Sox10 morpholino, rendering it inactive until illumination at 365 nm resulted in cleavage of the photo-morpholino and release of the antisense morpholino. This process allowed for the inhibition of Sox10 protein production from a specific time point onward and had the advantage of leaving Sox10-related processes such as early neural crest development intact. In addition, this experimental setup allowed for the injection of a single oligonucleotide cocktail into both control (not photocleaved) and experimental (photocleaved) embryos, reducing the variability inherent in morpholino-based experiments."

In addition, some uninjected embryos were illuminated to control for any effects of UV light (data not shown). While control embryos developed normal numbers and organization of olfactory sensory neurons at 38 hpf (Figure 6A,A') and 54 hpf (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), knockdown of Sox10 expression at 24 hpf specifically impeded microvillous neuron formation and organization (Figure 6B,B' and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Knockdown at the earlier 17.5 hpf time point had an even more pronounced effect (data not shown), since it allowed more time for degradation of existing Sox10 protein before the start of ingression. Importantly, the later 24 hpf time point of photocleavage occurs well after neural crest cells have populated the nasal cavity, and results from that experiment decouple microvillous neurogenesis from earlier, critical roles of Sox10 in neural crest development and migration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Sox10 is required for ingression/differentiation from the nasal cavity into the olfactory epithelium to generate microvillous neurons."

Our conclusions are derived from several complementary lines of experimentation ranging from live imaging of migration to fate mapping via photoconversion and laser ablation to morpholino knockdown at specific time points. The cumulative results demonstrate that neural crest cells migrate anteriorly to form the mesenchymal nasal cavity. A subset of these cells expresses Ngn1 and upregulates Sox10 to high levels during ingression into the olfactory epithelium to form microvillous neurons. Laser ablation data confirm that the neural crest contribution is necessary for microvillous neurogenesis and that the olfactory placode is unable to compensate for the loss of this precursor population."

Notably, the reduction in microvillous neurons after the loss of Sox10 is accompanied by only minor effects on the placode-derived ciliated neurons with which they intermix. Therefore, there is no general loss of neurogenesis in the olfactory placode but rather a microvillous-specific phenotype. An observed slight decrease in ciliated neuron numbers and thinning of projections in morpholino-treated embryos, similar to that seen in the laser ablation experiments, is likely a secondary effect due to the absence of normally adjacent microvillous neurons. Ciliated neurons largely recover by 48 hpf development, whereas neural crest–derived microvillous neurons do not."

Sox10 is not only required for formation of sensory, sympathetic, and enteric neurons but also for glia and Schwann cells (Britsch et al., 2001; Sonnenberg-Riethmacher et al., 2001; Carney et al., 2006; Kelsh, 2006). It has been a matter of debate how much of this role is direct or indirect via Sox10's regulation of glial development (Britsch et al., 2001; Carney et al., 2006). Data shown here, namely Sox10's expression in and specific effect on microvillous neurons within the first several hours of olfactogenesis, demonstrate a direct effect on neurogenesis at least in the context of zebrafish olfactory development."

      "content": "The origins of various olfactory components have been the subject of considerable controversy in the literature. It was long assumed that olfactory sensory neurons derive solely from the olfactory placode (Hansen and Zeiske, 1993; Whitlock and Westerfield, 2000). Although two lineage analysis studies in mice suggested that a small subpopulation of unspecified olfactory sensory neurons may have a neural crest origin (Forni et al., 2011; Katoh et al., 2011), they relied upon Wnt1-Cre and P0-Cre, both of which suffer from lack of neural crest specificity. Furthermore, conflicting work by another group also using Wnt1-Cre lineage tracing found no contribution to neurons but rather a neural crest contribution only to olfactory ensheathing glia (Barraud et al., 2010). Interpretation of these experiments is made difficult by the fact that the Wnt1 marker is not entirely neural crest specific, as it is also expressed in the dorsal neural tube, otic placode, and several other regions (Riccomagno et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006; Freyer et al., 2011; Valenta et al., 2011). In zebrafish, Harden et al. (2012) suggest the idea of a possible neural crest contribution to olfactory ensheathing glia but not to sensory neurons, although they provide no direct evidence to substantiate this possibility. Here, by using photoconversion of Sox10-expressing neural crest cells, we were able to unequivocally follow individual neural crest cells from their site of origin in the dorsal neural tube to their ingression into the olfactory epithelium and differentiation into microvillous sensory neurons."

Hence, analysis of their lineage, paths of differentiation, and molecular determinants may provide important insights into general mechanisms of self-renewal. Since processes of renewal may be lineage-dependent, understanding the embryonic origins of different classes of olfactory neurons has distinct value. In the case of placode-derived ciliated sensory neurons, their replenishment throughout the lifespan likely occurs within the mature olfactory vesicle. Similarly, there may be a subpopulation of microvillous sensory neurons derived from the olfactory vesicle. Consistent with this possibility, we see a small number of microvillous neurons that are Sox10:eGFP-negative. Alternatively, given our evidence of large-scale neural crest contribution to microvillous sensory neurons, it is intriguing to consider that their replacement during adulthood may take place via a latent neural crest stem cell population derived from the nasal cavity."

These data not only contradict existing dogma but open new avenues for better understanding sensory neurogenesis in the embryo and renewal in the adult. During vertebrate evolution, a myriad of changes have occurred in olfaction, including the emergence of the vomeronasal organ, which fish and birds appear to lack. Given the diverse nature of olfaction across species, it will be interesting to examine possible neural crest contributions from a comparative perspective as new lineage tracing tools become available in other model systems."

A sense photo-morpholino (AACCTACCGAPGTCACCTGTG) targets the antisense morpholino, with ‘P' at position 11 indicating a photocleavable moiety. The antisense morpholino was used at 7 ng per embryo as described above for the first antisense morpholino. A premixed solution was made at room temperature of antisense morpholino and sense photo-morpholino at a 1:1.1 molar ratio and injected into one- to two-cell embryos. After testing several permutations, photocleavage described here was done at 17.5 or 24 hpf on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 fluorescent microscope with a 5× objective and illumination via an Opti-Quip Model 1200 mercury lamp paired with a G365/FT395/LP420 filter set for 15 min, three to four embryos at a time. Some control embryos were injected but not photocleaved, and other control embryos were uninjected but illuminated under the same conditions as injected embryos to control for any effects of UV light illumination. Embryos were then incubated until later time points, and those appearing healthiest were selected for imaging with a laser scanning confocal microscope as before. Three independent experiments were performed with 12–15 embryos imaged per experiment."

This conclusion is based on a combination of live time-lapse filming, fate mapping Sox10-labelled cells (both generically and targeted in a number of ways), and laser ablation of Sox10 neural crest cells. In addition, the authors show that Sox10 levels increase during development and that knockdown of this transcription factor either by conventional morpholino or by a clever photo-activatable morpholino (to control the timing) leads to loss of olfactory microvillous cells. Overall the study is very well done, nicely illustrated, and the authors' arguments are generally well supported."

Hence, data has pointed towards a role for neural crest in contributing glia and neurons to the OE. This current paper convincingly locks down the neural crest origins of the specific microvillous population in zebrafish. Because studies have been done with multiple experimental systems it would be important to see a coherent set of experiments in one system and/or address the possibility of differences between species. That there may be a difference in the olfactory system of different vertebrate classes might make sense if there is a marked difference in the function of this system in air and water. For example, are the olfactory ensheathing cells in zebrafish also of neural crest origin? The authors might have that information in their data set and it would greatly enhance the value of the story to have it in the paper. It would go a long way towards confirming the lineage relationships that they see are consistent with mouse and chick results, which they imply in the paper. Ideally the authors should test at least some of their observations in a “dry” vertebrate (mouse or chick), but if this is not possible, the paper should be made very explicitly relevant to zebrafish in the title and abstract, as well as in the paper, to accommodate this possibility and to avoid confusing readers.10.7554/eLife.00336.017"

There are certainly important anatomical differences between fish and mammals, as mammals have a vomeronasal organ whereas fish do not, and the story in birds is ambiguous. Even within these structures there may be neuronal heterogeneity, which makes it critical to study these events in multiple species to increase understanding of the lineage relationships. Currently, mammalian experiments are severely limited by the lack of neural crest-specific labeling and the difficulty of live cell tracking. As new imaging technology becomes available in the future, we hope to overcome these technical limitations and gain new insights into these questions."

For this reason, we were unable to follow our labeled cells for long enough to observe cell bodies along the olfactory nerve. Further complicating this analysis, there are few/no good markers for glial cells in zebrafish. GFAP, a general glial marker in zebrafish, has a transgenic line described as having faint expression in some (unspecified, not shown) cells of the olfactory placode (Bernardos & Raymond, 2006), and a previously used anti-GFAP antibody in our hands is inconclusive or negative in olfactory labeling. Therefore, we are limited by the reagents available to test this interesting possibility. We are in the process of developing new transgenic tools that may allow this question to be answered, but the timeline precludes inclusion in this manuscript. As suggested, we have altered our title and abstract to make it clear that our data speak to sensory neurons specifically in the zebrafish model system. In addition, we have now included an additional neuronal marker (HuC/D) to further identify Sox10:GFP+ olfactory neurons."
