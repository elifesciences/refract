      "content": "Human positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) phosphorylates RNA polymerase II and regulatory proteins to trigger elongation of many gene transcripts. The HIV-1 Tat protein selectively recruits P-TEFb as part of a super elongation complex (SEC) organized on a flexible AFF1 or AFF4 scaffold. To understand this specificity and determine if scaffold binding alters P-TEFb conformation, we determined the structure of a tripartite complex containing the recognition regions of P-TEFb and AFF4. AFF4 meanders over the surface of the P-TEFb cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit but makes no stable contacts with the CDK9 kinase subunit. Interface mutations reduced CycT1 binding and AFF4-dependent transcription. AFF4 is positioned to make unexpected direct contacts with HIV Tat, and Tat enhances P-TEFb affinity for AFF4. These studies define the mechanism of scaffold recognition by P-TEFb and reveal an unanticipated intersubunit pocket on the AFF4 SEC that potentially represents a target for therapeutic intervention against HIV/AIDS."

This process takes place as the stretch of DNA that defines the gene is transcribed into an RNA molecule and it is catalyzed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. However, this enzyme can become trapped, and another enzyme called P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) is needed to release it. P-TEFb and other elongation factors therefore have an important role in gene expression."

      "content": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that hijacks the gene expression processes in human immune cells to replicate the RNA genome of the virus. To do this, the virus produces a protein called Tat that recruits P-TEFb as part of a multi-protein machine called the super elongation complex. This ensures that the process of transcriptional elongation, and hence the overall replication process, is highly efficient. There are gaps, however, in our knowledge of the architecture of the super elongation complex, which is known to be organized on a flexible scaffold. In turn, the molecular basis for the interaction between HIV-1 Tat and P-TEFb within the super elongation complex is not well understood."

In addition to assisting with the expression of hundreds of human genes, super elongation complexes containing P-TEFb-AFF4 are hijacked in various forms of cancer and viral infections, including HIV/AIDS. Schulze-Gahmen et al. show that AFF4 can directly contact HIV-1 Tat, which binds to the P-TEFb-AFF4 complex much more strongly than it binds to P-TEFb alone. This suggests that HIV-1 Tat evolved to work within the super elongation complex. Moreover, Schulze-Gahmen et al. reveal that HIV-1 Tat binds to a cleft between the P-TEFb enzyme and the AFF4 protein, which raises the possibility that this cleft could be used as a target for anti-HIV/AIDS drugs."

      "content": "At many genes in humans—including the integrated HIV genome as well as loci that regulate development and mediate responses to stress—RNA polymerase II initiates transcription but forms a stable paused complex after the synthesis of 30–50 nucleotides (Lin et al., 2011; Levine, 2012; Luo et al., 2012a; Zhou et al., 2012). These paused polymerases are poised for rapid, synchronous efficient transcription. For these genes, escape of the paused polymerase from the promoter-proximal region and elongation of the mRNA are rate-limiting regulated processes. Promoter escape requires positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), a heterodimeric protein kinase composed of CDK9 and cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunits. P-TEFb triggers promoter escape by directly or indirectly stimulating phosphorylation of the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain and the associated factors, NELF (negative elongation factor) and DSIF (DRB sensitivity inducing factor). Consequently, recruitment of active P-TEFb to the paused polymerase complex serves as an important checkpoint for gene expression (Levine, 2012; Luo et al., 2012b; Zhou et al., 2012)."

Recent studies of gene fusions in myeloid leukemias (Lin et al., 2010; Yokoyama et al., 2010), as well as complexes recruited to the HIV promoter by the HIV Tat protein (He et al., 2010; Sobhian et al., 2010; Jager et al., 2012), uncovered a family of Super Elongation Complexes (SECs) that bring together active P-TEFb and other transcription elongation factors. The SECs act at many normal human genes to stimulate mRNA elongation not only by triggering promoter escape but also by limiting proteolytic degradation of transcription elongation factors and increasing the processivity of RNAP II (He et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2010; Biswas et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2012). The SECs also couple to the PAF complex, which stimulates efficient transcript elongation (He et al., 2011). In addition to P-TEFb, the SECs contain subunits in the AF4, ELL, and ENL/AF9 protein families. Despite the major roles of SECs in metazoan gene expression and human disease, little is known about the architecture of these complexes."

Here, we report the structural and functional analysis of P-TEFb in complex with the cognate binding site on the SEC scaffold protein, AFF4. These studies reveal that AFF4 recognizes P-TEFb by binding the CycT1 subunit on the side opposite from CDK9. AFF4 is positioned to make direct contacts with HIV-1 Tat. Tat increases the affinity of P-TEFb for AFF4 by over an order of magnitude in vitro and rescues P-TEFb binding of AFF4 interface mutants in vivo. These results suggest that the SEC scaffold is an unanticipated direct partner of HIV-1 Tat, and an intersubunit Tat-binding pocket in the AFF4-P-TEFb complex may afford an unexpected site to target with selective inhibitors of HIV transcription."

In one complex, an isolated helix containing AFF4 residues 3–21 bridges symmetry-related CDK9 molecules in the crystals (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). We focus on the shared features of the three independent complexes. Consistent with the coupling of folding to binding, AFF4 lacks intramolecular tertiary contacts as it snakes across the CycT1 surface. An extended segment in AFF4 tracks antiparallel to the H3′-H4′ loop in CycT1, and two short AFF4 helices fit into shallow grooves in CycT1 between H3′ and H5′ and the surface formed by H2′ and H3′ (Figure 2A). Compared to the separated models, 1457 Å2 of AFF4 and 1251 Å2 of CycT1 accessible surface are buried in the complex. Twenty-six of the 33 ordered residues in AFF4 contact CycT1, emphasizing the extensive recognition determinants in the scaffold."

A pocket between CycT1 Leu163-Val164-Arg165, Trp221, and Tyr224, for example, anchors AFF4 Phe35, which forms a classic edge-to-face interaction (Burley and Petsko, 1985) with the Tyr (Figure 2C). CycT1 Trp210 adjusts to create a site that buries AFF4 Pro38 and allows a short antiparallel β-sheet to form between AFF4 Tyr39-Val41 and CycT1 Asn 209-Glu211 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). CycT1 Trp207 shifts to form a hydrogen bond with the Gly57 carbonyl in the loop between the two AFF4 helices, additional van der Waals contacts with the loop backbone and nonpolar contacts with AFF4 residues Leu56 and Tyr59 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Eight intermolecular hydrogen bonds help establish the chemical complementarity between AFF4 and CycT1. Twenty-one of the 26 interacting residues in AFF4 are conserved in AFF1–3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2)."

AFF4 overlaps with the position of residues 243–259 in the superimposed P-TEFb cyclin subunit. To accommodate AFF4, helix H5′ straightens and residues 251–256 form a helical segment that packs against CycT1 helices H1 and H2' and forms part of the AFF4 binding surface. In addition to burying hydrophobic residues in the first AFF4 helix, the adjustments in CycT1 helix H5′ mediate formation of a hydrogen-bonded ion pair between AFF4 Arg51 and CycT1 Glu246. CycT1 Trp256, the last residue ordered in the AFF4 complex, moves over 13 Å upon AFF4 binding."

The AFF4 2–363 and 33–67 fragments bound to CycT1 with similar affinities (Table 2), suggesting that the ordered AFF4 segment in the crystal structure captures the major CycT1 binding determinants. Mutations throughout the CycT1 interaction surface reduced AFF4 binding (Figure 3A and Table 3). The Trp210Ala and Trp207Ala substitutions in CycT1 had the largest effects, respectively, reducing AFF4 affinity by 21- and 58-fold. These results point to these CycT1 Trp residues as interaction hotspots and suggest that contacts all along the interface observed in the crystal structure mediate AFF4 recognition."

Direct measurements of Tat affinity are problematic, however, because Tat is unstable in vitro in the absence of partners and difficult to maintain in an active form. To overcome this problem, we took advantage of a thermodynamic cycle that illustrates that AFF4 and Tat mutually influence the P-TEFb affinity of each other by the same amount (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In quantitative in vitro assays (Figure 4B and Table 2), the purified AFF42–73 peptide bound Tat-P-TEFb (Kd = 0.85 ± 0.15 nM) ∼11 times more tightly than P-TEFb (Kd = 10 ± 1 nM). The AFF42–363 segment also bound Tat-P-TEFb (Kd = 0.6 ± 0.1 nM) ∼11 times more tightly than P-TEFb (Kd = 7 ± 1 nM). These results support the model of direct Tat interactions with AFF4 and suggest that the AFF42–73 peptide includes the principal residues that contact Tat (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1)."

Cells were transfected with wild-type or mutant AFF4 containing a C-terminal 3× FLAG tag, and immunoprecipitations using an anti-FLAG antibody were probed for the presence of associated factors. Alanine substitutions in P-TEFb contacts such as AFF4 Phe35, Tyr59/Asp60, and Lys63/Asp64 reduced binding of P-TEFb but not the ELL2, AF9, or ENL subunits of the SEC (Figure 4C). These defects were rescued by overexpressing a stably integrated gene for Tat, which strengthened the AFF4-P-TEFb association. In contrast, tandem alanine substitutions for AFF4 Glu61/Met62, which are more exposed in the P-TEFb interface and predicted to contact Tat, caused a small reduction (∼30%) in the binding of P-TEFb that was not rescued by overexpressing Tat (Figure 4C). The specificity of these mutational effects supports the model that Tat interacts directly with AFF4."

In addition, the CDK9 kinase subunit structure is little changed upon AFF4 binding to P-TEFb (CDK915–360 RMSD = 0.54 Å vs 1BLQ). In vivo, the Glu13Ala/Arg14Ala AFF4 mutant in the heart of the CDK9 interface in the crystals is associated with a <25% decrease in transcription stimulation (Figure 3B) and little change in P-TEFb binding (Figure 4C). To measure if recruitment of P-TEFb to the SEC scaffold regulates the kinase, we assayed the effects of AFF4 on the in vitro phosphorylation of an RNA polymerase II CTD substrate by purified P-TEFb and Tat-P-TEFb (Bitoun et al., 2007). AFF42–73 inhibited CTD phosphorylation by approximately twofold in a purified system (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2). By comparison, Tat stimulated P-TEFb by sevenfold, and addition of AFF2-73 did not further stimulate the kinase activity of the Tat-P-TEFb complex. Taken together, these results point away from CDK9 as the primary physiological partner of AFF43–21 and suggest that AFF4 functions as a SEC scaffold but not an allosteric activator of CDK9."

      "content": "The AFF4-P-TEFb crystal structure reveals that a high density of contacts in residues 34–66 of the AFF4 scaffold mediates binding to the CycT1 subunit of P-TEFb. These contacts are largely conserved in AF4 family members and can be perturbed physically and functionally by mutations (Figure 3 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Consistent with these results, tandem alanine substitutions of Pro33/Leu34, Val41/Thr42, Arg51/Ile52, and Met55/Leu56 in the CycT1 binding site (but not Arg3/Glu4 or Glu25/Asp26 in the preceding segment) also reduce P-TEFb binding in vivo (Chou et al., 2012). The impacts of alanine substitutions on transcriptional stimulation by AFF4 (Figure 3B) show that residues in the P-TEFb interface, as well as helix stabilizing residues, play crucial roles. The additional sensitivity of transcriptional stimulation to alanine substitutions of disordered residues flanking the CycT1 binding site suggests that the flexibility and potential interactions with other ligands are important for function."

      "content": "HIV-1 Tat binds adjacent to AFF4, increases the affinity of AFF4 for P-TEFb by over an order of magnitude, and rescues P-TEFb binding to AFF4 interface mutants in vivo. The AFF4 Glu61/Met62 double alanine substitution in the proposed Tat interface blocks this rescue. These results suggest that direct contacts between Tat and the AFF4 scaffold in complex with P-TEFb mediate the selective recruitment of the SEC to the HIV promoter. The functional AFF4-Tat interface, including the acetylated Lys28 in Tat as a potential regulator of affinity (Kiernan et al., 1999), supports the idea that Tat evolved to function within the SEC. In the crystal structure of the (low-affinity) Tat-P-TEFb subcomplex (Tahirov et al., 2010), Tat binds to a relatively open groove. In the context of the AFF4-P-TEFb structure, however, AFF4 creates an unanticipated pocket for Tat (Figure 4D). This pocket may ultimately provide a suitable therapeutic target for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of Tat binding that selectively block HIV transcription."

Model restraints were removed in later stages of refinement. AFF4 was built manually and the model was adjusted using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The model was refined using gradient minimization with weight optimization and maximum-likelihood targets, TLS refinement, and individual atomic B-factor refinement. The model was checked against composite omit maps. Density was missing for residues 1–7 and 88–95 in CDK9 mol1 and mol3, and residues 1–7 and 89–97 in CDK9 mol2. Density also was absent for residues 1–7 and 253–264 in CycT1 mol1, residues 1–7 and 257–264 in CycT1 mol2 and mol3, and residues 2–33 and 67–73 in AFF4, mol1 and mol3.

For assays with 0.05 mM ATP, 0.15 μCi [32P]-γ-ATP was used, and for reactions with 0.5 mM ATP, 1.5 μCi [32P]-γ-ATP was used. Reactions in conventional tubes gave distinct less reproducible results. Purified recombinant P-TEFb or P-TEFb-Tat was pre-incubated with 500 ng purified recombinant GST-CTD (52 C-terminal domain repeats from human RNA polymerase) in the absence or presence of 0.3 µM purified AFF42–73 for 15 min at 20°C. After addition of ATP, the kinase reactions were stopped at different times by addition of 5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by measurement of the radioactive protein bands on a Typhoon phosphorimager (GE Healthcare)."

      "content": "The crystal structure reveals that an otherwise unstructured epitope within aff4 (residues 34–66) binds P-TEFb, and meanders across an exposed surface of the Cyclin T1 subunit. The structure is at relatively low resolution (2.9 Å), but the crystallography appears technically strong and the overall similarity of the three complexes in the asymmetric unit also lends confidence. The structure reveals how P-TEFb binds the aff4 scaffold, and the observed Cyclin T1-AFF4 interactions are strongly supported by extensive binding studies using mutant Cyclin T1 proteins and transcription activation data using mutant aff4 proteins. A very interesting point is that the bound aff4 peptide approaches the Tat binding site, suggesting that aff4 may contact Tat directly. This hypothesis is nicely supported by the demonstration that aff4 binds 11-fold more tightly to the P-TEFb:Tat complex than to P-TEFb alone. Supporting IP data also show that Tat expression can “rescue” the effects of aff4 mutations that would otherwise inhibit Cyclin T1 binding, although these studies do not unambiguously identify aff4 residues that contact Tat (Glu61/Met62 are presented as attractive candidates, but the binding/rescue effects are small). The discovery that Tat probably contacts aff4 directly is significant, and adds aff4 as an important component to the previously characterized pTEFb/Tat/TAR complex."

Testing one or two structure-based aff4 point mutants would address whether or not this (admittedly weak) contact actually occurs in solution. Both types of requested aff4 mutants could be analyzed in the FP competition experiments (as reported for other aff4 constructs in Table 2).10.7554/eLife.00327.020"

Moreover, K28 of Tat, which is engaged in the aff4 interaction in our model but exposed to solvent in the Tat-P-TEFb complex, is acetylated in vivo and this modification regulates Tat functions."

There is no doubt that the requested experiments could provide additional examples of the concepts we demonstrated, but they would not add new lines of proof."

Moreover, they would have pointed out that the 13/14 di-alanine mutant in the heart of the interface is associated with a <25% decrease in transcription stimulation (Figure 3B) and little change in P-TEFb binding (Figure 4C) in vivo."
