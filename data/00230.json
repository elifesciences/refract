      "content": "Patterns of spatial positioning of individuals within microbial communities are often critical to community function. However, understanding patterning in natural communities is hampered by the multitude of cell–cell and cell–environment interactions as well as environmental variability. Here, through simulations and experiments on communities in defined environments, we examined how ecological interactions between two distinct partners impacted community patterning. We found that in strong cooperation with spatially localized large fitness benefits to both partners, a unique pattern is generated: partners spatially intermixed by appearing successively on top of each other, insensitive to initial conditions and interaction dynamics. Intermixing was experimentally observed in two obligatory cooperative systems: an engineered yeast community cooperating through metabolite-exchanges and a methane-producing community cooperating through redox-coupling. Even in simulated communities consisting of several species, most of the strongly-cooperating pairs appeared intermixed. Thus, when ecological interactions are the major patterning force, strong cooperation leads to partner intermixing."

Some of these microorganisms are pathogens that cause diseases in animals, while others provide nutrients, including essential amino acids and vitamins; there are also microorganisms that have critical roles in recycling elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in the biosphere. In the natural world, microorganisms interact with their environment and with each other, often competing for space, light and nutrients, but sometimes they act cooperatively, which benefits all parties involved."

      "content": "Microbial communities exhibit spatial patterns that reflect the relative positioning of different microbes in a community. These patterns can be critical for the proper functioning of a microbial community. For example, in the microbial granules that digest organic compounds in waste water, the stratified pattern of different microbial species can be thought of as a sequence of catalysts needed to perform a series of biochemical processing steps. Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms that drive pattern formation in multispecies communities."

      "content": "Now, through a combination of simulations and experiments, Momeni et al. have identified two features of spatial patterns in two-population microbial communities when pattern formation is driven by fitness effects related to the ecological interactions between cells. First, interactions that confer significant advantages to at least one of the populations can potentially result in the generation of a stable community; the community is stable in the sense that if it is disturbed, it will return to its stable population composition following the disturbance. Indeed, in engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae communities, very different initial population ratios converged to the same value over time when one strain depended on the other strain, or when the two strains depended on each other, but not when the two strains competed."

      "content": "These two features of spatial patterning are conceptually similar to the competitive exclusion principle, which states that two species competing for the same resources cannot stably coexist if competition is the sole force at work. This principle has, therefore, encouraged scientists to search for the other forces that must be responsible for the coexistence of different species. Similarly, by predicting the sorts of patterns that will form when the fitness effects of ecological interactions between cells are the only forces at work, Momeni et al. lay the groundwork for investigations into other mechanisms, such as cell–environment interactions and active cell motility, that can govern pattern formation in microbial communities."

Patterning, reflecting the relative spatial positioning of individuals with respect to each other, can be critical for the proper functioning of a community. Consider microbial communities: in a synthetic community, three bacterial species, each contributing an essential benefit while simultaneously competing for these benefits, can only grow when they are separated by an intermediate distance (Kim et al., 2008); different types of patterning are correlated with different levels of biofilm growth (Christensen et al., 2002; Brenner and Arnold, 2011); branching colony morphology allows more effective spreading across a nutrient-poor surface (Levine and Ben-Jacob, 2004); and in waste treatment granules, the layered pattern of bacteria and archaea is thought to facilitate the sequential degradation of substrates (Satoh et al., 2007)."

Understanding the mechanistic basis of pattern formation from observations of natural communities is stymied by the multitude of cell–cell and cell–environment interactions, as well as environmental variations within and across communities. Thus, it is not uncommon to observe qualitatively different patterns in samples of essentially the same type of community (Christensen et al., 2002; Wilmes et al., 2008; Dekas et al., 2009)."

Interactions can be classified into different ecological types based on their fitness effects on the interacting partners. We focused on the fitness effects rather than the molecular mechanisms of interactions, because diverse molecular mechanisms, ranging from physical associations in cell coaggregates and biofilms (Kolenbrander et al., 2010) to chemical interactions such as quorum sensing (Parsek and Greenberg, 2005), toxin warfare (Vetsigian et al., 2011), and metabolite supply (Christensen et al., 2002), all have fitness consequences which can be positive, neutral, or negative. Among different ecological interactions, we have placed a special emphasis on strong cooperation, interactions with large positive fitness effects on both partners including obligatory cooperation. This is because 1) it is important in a wide variety of microbial communities ranging from syntrophic systems critical for nutrient cycling (Schink, 2002; Falkowski et al., 2008; McInerney et al., 2009) to pathogenic biofilms (Kelly, 1980; Kolenbrander et al., 2010; Elias and Banin, 2012); and 2) the codependence between cooperative partners poses special challenges for isolating and culturing cells (Schink, 2002; McInerney et al., 2009)."

We tested these predictions experimentally in obligatory cooperative systems including engineered yeast communities and syntrophic methanogenic biofilms. Finally, we used the fitness model to show ‘strongly cooperating partners intermix’ could be generalized to communities consisting of multiple species.r^G−r^R=0"

The two populations engaged in one of the six ecological interactions. Population ratios for the entire community and patterns of vertical cross sections were examined. (B) The fitness model predicts that strong interactions beneficial to at least one partner can potentially lead to the convergence of initially disparate population ratios (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). (C)–(H) Representative vertical cross-sections of simulated communities, each engaging in one of the six types of ecological interactions, are presented. The fitness effects of ↑and ↓are large compared to the non-zero basal fitness of the recipient (Figure 1—source data 1), and therefore [↑ ↑] is strong facultative cooperation. (I) Vertical cross-sections of single-cell thickness from cooperative communities show significantly more intermixing than those from other communities (n = 28 sections; p<0.01, Mann–Whitney U test). An intermixing index of 6 (red dotted line) or above separates cooperative from non-cooperative communities in our simulations. To reduce the correlation of sections sampled from the same community, nearest sections were separated by at least seven sections."

When the group of cells reached approximately 5-cell radius (c, hour 14), cells in the center could no longer push other cells to the side and instead budded upward, as indicated by higher intensities in the fluorescence images. Continued growth of microcolony forced more cells in the middle to send their progeny to upper layers, while cells close to the edge could still push other cells to the side and remained on the agarose surface (d, hour 17.5). Scale bars are 20 μm. (B) In simulations of the diffusion and fitness models, a focal budding cell (star) was assumed to bud toward the nearest empty space within its coplanar (x,y) confinement neighborhood of n-cell radius (left panel, magenta circle). If the nearest empty space was not unique, a random choice was made. Cells along the path (yellow rim) to the nearest empty space shifted positions (left panel, cyan arrows) to accommodate the new cell. During rearrangement, if a cell moved to a new position with no cells immediately below it, the cell was lowered until it landed on another cell or the agarose surface. If the confinement neighborhood was filled, the cell budded upward and pushed up all cells above it (right panel)."

Therefore, for simplicity, we use [∼ ∼] to denote the ‘baseline’ competition. The fitness effect of baseline competition can start at zero if shared resources are in excess, but will eventually become negative as shared resources become limited. In ‘addition’ to competition, interactions between two partners can exert positive, negative, or no fitness effects on one or both partners. The ‘net’ fitness effects of all interactions between two partners, including competition, on the two partners can be represented as two symbols in a square bracket. There are six possibilities:[∼ ∼] (no fitness effects other than those from baseline competition), [∼ ↑] (commensalism, in which one partner experiences nothing more than competition whereas the other enjoys an overall fitness benefit even when competition has been taken into consideration), [∼ ↓] (amensalism), [↓ ↓] (mutual antagonism), [↓ ↑] (victim-exploiter), and [↑ ↑] (cooperation). The identities of partners may be added to the notation such that A[↓ ↑]B would mean that the overall interaction (including competition) inhibits A and promotes B. Under this notation, inter-population toxin-warfare (Vetsigian et al., 2011) would be [↓ ↓] while inter-population cooperation based on the exchange of distinct net benefits would be [↑ ↑]. Some interactions may at the first sight seem cooperative, but the net interaction may turn out not to be cooperative after considering the negative effects of competition (Kim et al., 2008). In the game theory definition, cooperative acts incur fitness costs to the performers. Here we have taken a more liberal definition of cooperation to include mutually-beneficial interactions that may or may not involve fitness costs."

Specifically, two populations of cells, marked as red and green, were initially randomly distributed on a surface (Figure 1A). Cells grew horizontally until sufficiently confined, at which point they grew upward to accommodate the birth of new cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1, Video 1). Thus, no active cell motility was present during community growth. The growth rate of a focal cell was determined by its basal fitness as a single cell and by its interactions with other cells in a defined interaction neighborhood. To reflect the negative fitness effects of intra- and inter-population competition for shared resources ([∼ ∼]), the fitness of the focal cell was decreased as the total population size in the interaction neighborhood increased. In addition, the focal and partner cells affected each other’s fitness positively (↑), negatively (↓), or neutrally (∼). The magnitude of fitness effect is quantitative. Thus, to obtain qualitative ecological patterning rules, we focused on strong interactions in which ↑ and ↓ exert fitness effects large enough to be comparable to the recipient’s basal fitness. In most simulations using the fitness model, the basal fitnesses of both partners were non-zero, and therefore ↑ represented strong facultative interactions: a participant could survive on its own at its basal fitness but fared much better in the presence of its partner."

Simulations (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 1—source data 1) and analytical calculations (‘Requirements for steady-state ratios in the six types of communities’ in ‘Materials and methods’) show that for interactions benefiting at least one partner, including cooperation ([↑ ↑]), commensalism ([∼ ↑]), and exploitation ([↓ ↑]), different initial partner ratios can potentially converge over time (Figure 1B). Ratio convergence requires ‘balanced’ fitness. For example, for A[∼ ↑]B to achieve ratio convergence, the basal fitness of A must be higher than that of B and after gaining the fitness benefit from commensalism, B must be able to grow at least as fast as A. This way, a situation incompatible to ratio convergence, that is, one partner always fitter than the other, does not occur. Using engineered competitive, obligatory commensal, and obligatory cooperative yeast communities (see below), we confirmed that population ratios converged in the commensal and cooperative but not competitive communities (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). This convergence of population ratios reflects a balance between supply and consumption when growth is limited by supply (Shou et al., 2007): if, for instance, the supplier population suddenly increased in relative abundance, then each individual in the consumer population would receive more benefit and grow faster, which would return the ratio to its original value."

In [∼ ∼], [∼ ↓], and [↓ ↓], red and green populations primarily formed columns that are spatially segregated from each other (Figure 1C–E). In [↑ ↓] and [∼ ↑], frequently one of the populations (green) either formed a column or became covered by the partner population (red) (Figure 1F–G). Only in cooperation ([↑ ↑]) conferring large fitness benefits to both partners, the two partner populations appeared to be extensively ‘intermixed’, manifested as the two different cell types successively piling on top of each other (Figure 1H)."

Depending on their genetic backgrounds, the two strains engaged in either equal-fitness or unequal-fitness competition. In obligatory commensal communities, R→A←L took in lysine from the media and overproduced adenine to feed the adenine-requiring G←A (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). In obligatory cooperative communities (previously described as Cooperation that is Synthetic and Mutually Obligatory, or “CoSMO”), R→A←L overproduced adenine and required lysine while G→L←A overproduced lysine and required adenine (Shou et al., 2007) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C). When mixed, the two cooperative strains could form a viable community, growing from low to high densities in synthetic minimal medium (SD) lacking adenine and lysine (Shou et al., 2007)."

Most parameters in the diffusion model were measured experimentally (Figure 2—source data 1). We reasoned that if predictions from the diffusion model were consistent with experimental observations, we could use this model to simulate experiments that would be technically difficult to perform."

This is because confocal and two-photon microscopy cannot penetrate deep into yeast communities (Váchová et al., 2009). In competitive communities, whether in the diffusion model or experiments, time-lapse top-views suggested population segregation. For equal-fitness competitive communities (Figure 2A, left; Video 2), individual cells (i) grew into microcolonies (ii) which continued to grow and expand until they reached neighboring microcolonies (iii). After this stage, cells were unable to push other cells to the side, and further cell divisions mainly occurred in the vertical z direction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Consequently, columns of primarily a single cell type formed, and top-views of the community remained static (compare iv and v). Competitive communities composed of populations with different fitnesses developed similarly (Figure 2A, right; Video 3), except that the fitter population expanded in the top view during growth (compare the green population in iv and v).R→A←Lλz*"

When competing strains had different fitnesses (unequal-fitness competition, abbreviated as ‘Uneq-fitness Comp.’), the fitter population G expanded during growth, as evident in top views (A, right) and vertical cross-sections (D, right). In obligatory commensal communities, since one supplier could support the birth of multiple consumers, consumers eventually overgrew and covered suppliers (top-views in B and vertical cross-sections in E). Obligatory cooperative communities showed substantial population intermixing as suggested by alternating cell types in top-views (C, 6× magnification insets in experiments) and patchy cross-section patterns (F). Top views of communities from the diffusion model integrate intensity and color over height such that brighter colors represent higher cell numbers and yellowness indicates the simultaneous presence of green and red. Scale bar: 100 μm. All communities started from total 500 cells/mm2 and R:G = 1:1. (G) Quantification of intermixing in experimental (symbols) and diffusion-model (lines) communities showed that while the intermixing index remained low for commensal (brown) and competitive (grey and black) communities, it increased linearly with community height in obligatory cooperative (magenta) communities. Results from the diffusion model underestimated intermixing indexes because a confined cell was modeled to divide strictly vertically upward (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) without allowing cell movements in horizontal directions (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). (H) A conceptual model illustrates the development of intermixing over time in a strongly cooperative community with 1:1 steady-state population ratio. Local deviations from the steady-state ratio result from asymmetric partner properties and/or stochastic fluctuations in cell numbers (i). The under-abundant population (red) grows faster than its neighboring over-abundant partner (green). Due to the spatial localization of large cooperative benefits, cells near population borders grow faster than those farther away. Consequently, cells from the initially under-abundant red population at the border divide the fastest. Progeny that pile on the green partner have more access to cooperative benefits than those who do not (ii), which favors intermixing. When the previously over-abundant partner becomes under-abundant (iii), piling-up in the opposite direction occurs (iv, green on red)."

We found that in both the diffusion model and experiments, R→A←L initially grew rapidly by consuming lysine in the agarose (compare i, ii, and iii). In contrast, G←A initially grew slowly, presumably limited by the low level of adenine released by R→A←L before R→A←L became abundant (compare i, ii, and iii). During the growth of R→A←L, some G←A cells had been pushed to the top layer of the community (iii). As the R→A←L population continued to expand and release adenine, G←A started to grow rapidly (compare iii and iv). Eventually, R→A←L stopped growing after lysine in the agarose had been depleted. Since the amount of adenine released during the lifetime of every R→A←L cell could support the birth of multiple G←A cells (Shou et al., 2007), G←A population outnumbered and covered R→A←L (v).R→A←L[∼↑]G←A"

After plating on agarose lacking adenine and lysine (i), cells in both populations divided once or twice by utilizing metabolites stored in their vacuoles (Shou et al., 2007). R→A←L released adenine and entered the death phase while G→L←A continued to grow by utilizing the released adenine (ii) (Shou et al., 2007). G→L←A entered the death phase and released lysine after a significant delay due to their better starvation tolerance compared to R→A←L (Shou et al., 2007). Released lysine supported the growth of surviving R→A←L cells into microcolonies (iii). R→A←L in turn released adenine which promoted growth of nearby G→L←A cells and led to partial covering up of R→A←L microcolonies by rapidly growing G→L←A (iv and v, insets). Abundant G→L←A cells provided enough lysine for rapid growth of local R→A←L cells, which gave rise to patches of R→A←L cells on top of the community (vi, inset). These community growth kinetics were consistent with previous measurements in liquid cultures (Shou et al., 2007).R→A←L[↑ ↑]G→L←A"

Unequal-fitness (Figure 2D, right) and obligatory commensal communities (Figure 2E) displayed a layered pattern in which the top portion of a community was dominated by one partner. In contrast to competitive and obligatory commensal communities, obligatory cooperative communities appeared to show population intermixing with patches of red and green cells emerging on top of each other (Figure 2F and Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and B). Cooperative intermixing appeared to be less in the diffusion model than in yeast communities. This is presumably because the diffusion model assumed that a confined cell would bud strictly upward whereas in yeast communities, cell divisions could stray to the side (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F)."

As expected, equal-fitness competition resulted in small intermixing indexes at all community heights (Figure 2G, grey). In unequal-fitness competition (Figure 2G, black) and obligatory commensalism (Figure 2G, brown), the formation of a layered pattern caused a small increase in the intermixing index that subsequently leveled off. In contrast, the intermixing index in obligatory cooperative communities increased proportionally to community height in both experiments and the diffusion model (Figure 2G, magenta). This proportionality suggested the existence of a characteristic patch size (‘Spatial analysis’ in ‘Materials and methods’), denoted λz*, of 10–20 µm. The characteristic patch size was independent of initial conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A). Indeed, a calculation of the patch size based on experimentally-determined release, diffusion, and consumption of exchanged metabolites yielded comparable results (‘Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities’ in ‘Materials and methods’)."

Using the diffusion model, we found that if cooperative benefits were not spatially localized because of instant distribution of benefits throughout the community or because of excessive supply levels, intermixing was diminished (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). Based on this result and based on patterns observed in top-views and vertical cross-sections of cooperative communities, we propose that local deviations from the steady-state ratio coupled with localized large cooperative benefits cause partners to ‘take turns’ to grow, which leads to population intermixing (Figure 2H). In summary, in communities engaging in strong cooperation, but not in communities governed by other types of ecological interactions, the intermixing index increases proportionally as a function of community height. This proportionality is due to a fixed patch size determined by localized nutrient supply and consumption."

First, we experimentally tested partner intermixing in obligatory yeast cooperative communities initiated under different population ratios and densities. Next, we used the diffusion model to examine communities in which obligatory cooperative partners interacted with different dynamics. Finally, using the fitness model, we tested intermixing in facultative cooperation by varying the relative magnitude of cooperative benefits compared to the basal fitness of the two interacting populations. We utilized yeast communities when experimentally possible and otherwise took advantage of the diffusion and the fitness models."

The initial partner ratio did not significantly affect the level of intermixing (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). At very high initial cell densities, we observed significant intermixing in communities directly above the inoculation area even in the absence of cooperation (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, yellow shading). This is because high cell densities put different cell types in close proximity to one another, and cell divisions that were not perfectly straight upward (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F) caused intermixing. However, we reasoned that communities beyond the inoculation area might reveal patterns indicative of the underlying interactions, because these regions are formed by cell growth under the fitness influences of interactions. To test this possibility, we spotted cell mixtures at high densities on agarose and allowed the community to expand to new territories beyond the inoculation area. Even though communities directly above the inoculum always appeared highly intermixed (Figure 3A, ‘Center’ and Figure 2—figure supplement 4C), in edge sections, significant intermixing was only observed in cooperative communities (Figure 3A, ‘Edge’ and Figure 2—figure supplement 4D)."

A total of 106 R and G cells at a 1:1 ratio were deposited in an inoculation spot of ∼2 mm2, corresponding to 10 cell layers. Communities were allowed to grow and expand beyond the inoculation spot on a 4-mm-tall agarose pad of 500 mm2 area. Vertical sections from the edges were taken at a height approximately half of the maximum community height at the center. Box plots show the 25th to 75th percentile range, with the median marked with a line and whiskers extending to the 95% confidence interval. (B) In simulations using the fitness model, facultative cooperation conferring smaller fitness benefits required greater community heights to exhibit a significant level of intermixing. The strength of facultative cooperation is shown as the ratio of fitness benefit received from each cooperative partner cell in the interaction neighborhood to the basal fitness of the focal cell. Simulation parameters can be found in Figure 3—source data 1. Error bars indicate 95% confidence interval."

      "content": "(A) Partner intermixing is insensitive to diffusion constants. In the diffusion model, obligatory cooperative communities with diffusion constants ranging from 20 to 360 µm2/s (corresponding to the diffusion constants of Sulforhodamine 101 in yeast community and agarose, respectively) both showed significant partner intermixing during growth. (B) Partner intermixing is insensitive to the kinetics of interactions. With or without incorporating details such as significantly better starvation tolerance in adenine-requiring cells compared to lysine-requiring cells and the consequent delay in lysine release compared to adenine release (Shou et al., 2007), the diffusion model (lines) yielded substantial population intermixing. Diffusion constant within the community was assumed to be 20 μm2/s. In both (A) and (B), communities started from 3000 total cells/mm2 at 1:1 population ratio. (C) Intermixing does not depend on asymmetry between cooperating partners. We examined symmetric obligatory cooperation by assuming that for the two partners, all live cells released nutrients at a constant and identical rate without delay, and that other properties such as rates of growth, death, and nutrient consumption were also identical. Partner intermixing in this symmetric obligatory cooperative system (Sym. coop) was similar to that in asymmetric obligatory yeast cooperative system (Coop). Simulated communities started from total 500 cells/mm2 at 1:1 population ratio. (D) Cooperative intermixing is insensitive to initial ratios. Engineered yeast communities were initiated at a total cell density of 3000 cells/cm2 and grown to near the carrying capacity of the agarose column. Box plots show 25th to 75th percentile values of the intermixing index, with the median marked with a line and whiskers extending to 95% confidence interval. To facilitate comparisons, intermixing indexes in communities with different heights were linearly normalized to correspond to a height of ∼40 cell layers (200 µm). (E) Experimental obligatory cooperative communities (magenta) showed more intermixing than obligatory commensal (brown), equal-fitness competitive (grey), and unequal-fitness competitive (black) communities, except when the initial cell densities exceeded 10% confluence (yellow shading). Large intermixing indexes at high initial cell densities were due to the fact that the budding direction of a cell under spatial confinement was not exactly vertical (F). To facilitate comparisons, intermixing indexes in communities with different heights were linearly normalized to correspond to a height of ∼30 cell layers (150 µm). Communities were initiated at R:G = 1:1 and grown until near the carrying capacity of the agarose. Box plots show the 25th to 75th percentile range, with the median marked with a line and whiskers representing 95% confidence intervals. (F) An equal-fitness competitive community was initiated at confluent density (50000 cells/mm2) and R:G = 100:1 to ensure that single green cells were laterally confined by red cells. Cross-sections showed that the early progeny of a single cell was distributed in a division zone of ∼3-cell rather than 1-cell width. Lateral budding by late progeny further widens the zone to ∼5-cell diameter in a mature community. Scale bar is 20 µm."

As described above, in the diffusion model, excessive supply amounts or instant distribution of benefits throughout the community diminished intermixing (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B). The former can occur if the local availability of cooperative benefits is not growth-limiting. However, cooperative benefits are unlikely to be available in large excess because of the potential fitness cost of generating benefits and because of competition for these benefits in the partner population. As far as diffusion is considered, the diffusion model showed significant population intermixing in obligatory cooperative communities with diffusion constants varying more than 10-fold (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). Additional calculations showed that intermixing was largely insensitive to diffusion kinetics, because the characteristic patch size was related to the diffusion constant by 1/5 power (‘Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities’ in ‘Materials and methods’). The diffusion model also showed that intermixing was present with or without a delay in G→L←A supplying lysine benefits to the partner (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Furthermore, even though asymmetry between properties of partners (Figure 2C) would seem to facilitate intermixing (Figure 2H), asymmetry in partner properties was not required to generate intermixed patterns: partners that grew, died, and released and consumed metabolites at identical rates intermixed (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C)."

This result is intuitive: facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory cooperation if fitness benefits are large for both partners. When only one partner receives a large fitness benefit, facultative cooperation should resemble obligatory commensalism. Finally, small fitness benefits for both partners will make facultative cooperation resemble competition. In facultative cooperation with smaller fitness benefits, intermixing would be apparent if communities could grow to greater heights. Further experiments are required to test these predictions. Together, these results suggest that intermixing relies on spatial localization of cooperative benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners, and is otherwise insensitive to initial conditions or the detailed kinetics of interactions."

In the absence of sulfate and hydrogen, the two species engage in obligatory mutualism: D. vulgaris ferments lactate and promotes the growth of M. maripaludis by supplying the electron donor H2, while M. maripaludis promotes the growth of D. vulgaris by consuming the H2 gas which can be inhibitory to D. vulgaris under these conditions (Figure 4A). Similar types of syntrophic interactions leading to methane production typically occur in microbial consortia that digest organic compounds in freshwater sediments, sewage treatment plants, and the guts of ruminants (Conrad et al., 1985; Schink, 1997)."

Dv ferments lactate and produces mainly acetate, CO2, and H2. However, this reaction is not thermodynamically favorable unless H2 is kept at very low concentrations. H2 is used by Mm to reduce CO2 to methane. (B) In cooperative biofilms of Dv (green) and Mm (red), the intermixing index increased with height. Cell identification relied on FISH (see ‘Materials and methods’). Scale bar: 20 µm."

      "content": "In communities with more than two species, indirect interactions can obscure direct interactions (Wootton, 2002). For example, if A promotes B which inhibits C, it will appear that A inhibits C. This is akin to indirect interactions between gene products in a cell. To test whether intermixing between cooperators was affected by other members of a community, we used the fitness model to simulate communities composed of five interacting species (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We randomly assigned one of the six possible ecological interactions between each pair of populations, and consequently, each network had 10 pair-wise interactions. The fitness effects of ↑ and ↓ were sufficiently large to be comparable to the recipient’s basal fitness. A total of 240 pair-wise interactions in 24 independent communities were examined in the fitness model. In most cases (26 out of 31), cooperative pairs intermixed (Figure 5A,D). Occasionally, commensal pairs (Figure 5B, ② [∼ ↑] ③) showed substantial intermixing (3 out of 58 commensal pairs, Figure 5D), or cooperative pairs (e.g., Figure 5C, ① [↑ ↑] ③) showed little intermixing (5 out of 31, Figure 5D), presumably due to interactions through other community members (Figure 5B, ③ indirectly promoted ② through ④; Figure 5C, ③ promoted ⑤ which inhibited ①). These deviations are consistent with the notion that the intermixing index reflects the ‘overall’ interaction between two partners, integrating any additional fitness effects of indirect interactions through other community members. Thus, strongly cooperating partners intermix while deviations from this expectation reflect the presence of strong indirect interactions."

The basal fitness for each population was chosen randomly from a range spanning 0.03–0.05/hr. The fitness effect from each partner cell in the interaction neighborhood was either 0 for ∼, or otherwise randomly chosen to be approximately 2–3% of basal fitness to achieve strong interaction. Initial population ratios were randomly assigned such that no population was initially lower than 5% of the total population. Simulations were run for 10 generations, and vertical cross-sections of the final communities were examined for intermixing. We considered intermixing index exceeding a threshold of 6 (Figure 1I) as significant (red dotted lines). The remaining nine panels in Figure 5B and C are provided in Figure 5–figure supplement 1. (D) Quantifying intermixing in a total of 240 interactions from 24 independent communities showed that most of the cooperative pairs intermixed (magenta). Indirect interactions through other community members could make cooperative pairs not intermixed (grey) or non-cooperative (commensal) pairs intermixed (brown)."

      "content": "The first expectation is that interactions conferring large fitness benefits to at least one partner ([↑ ↑], [∼ ↑], and [↓ ↑]) can potentially result in ratio convergence (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Ratio convergence confers stability to community composition. The composition of a community is defined to be locally (or globally) stable if after small (or any-size) deviations from it, either due to initial conditions different from it or perturbations, the community eventually returns to this composition. An analytical calculation based on the fitness model showed that in [↑ ↑] and [∼ ↑], global stability can be achieved whereas in [↓ ↑], local stability can be achieved (Figure 1—figure supplement 2; ‘Requirements for steady-state ratios in the six types of communities’ in ‘Materials and methods’). Experimentally, obligatory cooperation and obligatory commensalism led disparate initial ratios to converge (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In contrast, in competition between two populations of equal fitness, population ratio is determined by the initial value until a perturbation resets the value which will remain unchanged until the next perturbation. In competition between two populations of unequal fitness, the fitter population should increase in frequency and therefore, population ratio is unstable. In amensalism and mutual antagonism, population ratios at best have an unstable fixed point (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). This means that even if the population ratio may seem ‘fixed’, slight deviations will send it farther and farther away from the original fixed value. The reason for this instability, using mutual antagonism as an example, is because if A inhibits B and B inhibits A (A[↓ ↓]B), then an increase in population A will facilitate inhibition of B and therefore make B less able to inhibit A, further increasing the relative abundance of A."

Cooperative intermixing requires spatially localized benefits that are sufficiently large to both partners (Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3B), and otherwise appears to be robust against variations in initial conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, Figure 3A, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D) or reaction dynamics (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C). We have observed cooperative intermixing in the fitness model simulating strong facultative cooperation (Figure 1) and in obligatory experimental systems including engineered yeast communities (Figure 2) and syntrophic biofilms (Figure 4). The intermixing indexes in these communities increased linearly as a function of community height, because these communities exhibited fixed-size patches associated with the spatial localization of benefits (Figure 2—figure supplement 3; ‘Calculating the characteristic patch size in cooperative yeast communities’ in ‘Materials and methods’). This is in stark contrast with other ecological interactions which lead to segregated or layered patterns (Figures 1 and 2) in which the intermixing index remained low or increased transiently before leveling off. In simulated multi-species communities, strongly cooperative pairs intermixed in most cases; cases where cooperative pairs did not intermix or non-cooperative pairs intermixed were likely caused by strong indirect interactions through other partners. In a theoretical study using a one-dimensional stepping-stone model, strongly cooperating partners also appeared much more mixed than competing partners (Korolev and Nelson, 2011)."

The generality of these ecological patterning conclusions awaits further experimental validations. Many simple communities grown in laboratory environments conform to these findings. For instance, competing bacterial species form a columnar or layered pattern (Palmer et al., 2001; Kreth et al., 2005; An et al., 2006; Hallatschek et al., 2007; Bernstein et al., 2012). Burkholderia sp. LB400 and Pseudomonas sp. B13(FR1) show spatial segregation as competitors when grown on citrate, but when grown on chlorobiphenyl they engage in metabolic commensalism and exhibit a layered pattern (Nielsen et al., 2000). Similarly, when grown on a non-selective carbon source, Comamonas testosteroni WDL7 outcompeted and covered Variovorax sp. WDL1, but when fed with an aromatic compound as the sole carbon source, competition switched to cooperation and the two populations intermixed (Breugelmans et al., 2008). Cooperative oral bacteria species intermixed when grown on saliva (Palmer et al., 2001; Periasamy and Kolenbrander, 2009). If cooperative intermixing is suspected, then examining whether the intermixing index increases linearly as a function of community height will be informative to exclude transient increases."

This type of cell rearrangement has also been observed in bacterial colonies (Kreft et al., 1998) and was adopted to model biofilm growth (Xavier and Foster, 2007). However, it is conceivable that if at least one population actively moves (Houry et al., 2012) or grows hyphae to penetrate the entire community, two populations might appear intermixed even if they do not cooperate. In biofilms of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two populations differing only in fluorescent colors (Klausen et al., 2003) showed modest intermixing even though the expectation for equal-fitness competition is a columnar pattern with an intermixing index close to zero (Figure 2D, left). This modest intermixing was caused by P. aeruginosa differentiating into non-motile ‘stalk’ cells that anchored to the surface and motile cells that climbed up to form the mushroom-like caps (Klausen et al., 2003)."

Stochastic events such as environmental variability, mutations, or fluctuations in initial conditions can all lead to variable patterns. For instance, if the straight-columnar pattern expected for equal-fitness competition is observed for the majority of community but a layered pattern is observed in occasional locations, then fitter mutants may have arisen in these locations, initiating unequal-fitness competition (Hallatschek et al., 2007; Korolev et al., 2012). For mutually antagonistic interactions, the fitness model showed that population ratios can quickly diverge. Thus, which population eventually dominates depends on the initial population ratio (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). In this case, stochastic variations in initial conditions can result in dramatically different patterns, giving rise to a phenomenon equivalent to ‘survival of the first’. Indeed, different patterns have been observed for communities formed by two antagonistic bacteria species (Kuramitsu et al., 2007)."

The competitive exclusion principle, also known as Gause’s law, states that two species competing for the exact same resources cannot stably coexist. Analogous to how the competitive exclusion principle has created a framework to examine forces that cause species coexistence, our work on ecological patterning will hopefully lay the ground for examining mechanisms that shape patterning in microbial communities. We encourage comments, especially those pertaining to the generality of our conclusions, to be posted to the eLife website."

After 20 min, the communities were transferred to a pre-cooled empty plate at −20°C to allow methanol to evaporate, which typically took 4 hr. The communities were embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound for 10 min at room temperature and subsequently frozen over dry ice and kept at −20°C for sectioning. We also froze down communities without fixing by directly embedding them in OCT (Piccirillo et al., 2010) and immediately freezing them on dry ice. Results obtained from the two procedures yielded similar conclusions."

In any unit of analysis, community height is the value such that 90% of height values are below it. This choice is made to exclude artifacts such as height spikes in simulations. Images of experimental community sections were rotated in ImageJ such that the x–z axes of the frame matched those of the community. We further digitized these images into f(x,z) with assigned values of +1, −1, and 0 for pixels identified as population 1, population 2, and no-signal, respectively. No-signal pixels were defined as having a fluorescence intensity per unit exposure time less than 10–20% above the background in fluorescence channels. For the remaining pixels, the intensity values of 90th percentiles were found in each fluorescence channel. These values were used to normalize the corresponding green- or red-fluorescence intensity for each pixel whose identity was then assigned to be the color with the higher normalized value. In simulated communities with more than two populations, analysis was performed on two focal colors at a time, and in each analysis, pixels identified as other colors were treated as no-signal."

The number of consuming cells within the diffusion domain can be estimated as Nu = (2l/c)3, where c is the diameter of a cell. The average time nutrient can diffuse in the diffusion domain before being consumed is tc = l2/2D1, where D1 = 360 μm2/s is the diffusion constant within the community. Assuming that each consuming cell takes up lysine with a rate v ≤ αL/T, with αL being the amount of lysine required for a cell division and T being the minimum doubling time, we have"

Thus, the probability of a second release event occurring in the same diffusion domain before nutrient from the first release event has been consumed is low. Therefore, l defines the interaction length scale. Note that diffusion constant contributes by fifth root to l, and therefore, different diffusion constants in the community should not considerably alter patterns, as observed in simulations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). The calculated l of 50 μm is larger than the experimental patch size λz* of ∼10 to 20 μm. What could account for this discrepancy? Experimentally measured diffusion constant of Sulforhodamine 101 in community (20 µm2/s) reduces l to ∼30 µm. In addition, cells may take up more nutrients than what is required for producing one daughter and may store extra nutrients in vacuoles (Shou et al., 2007), further reducing the estimated interaction length scale."

Consider population i (i = R or G) interacting with population j (j = G or R). Without loss of generality, consider a focal cell from population i. The growth of the focal cell is influenced by cells in its cubic three-axial interaction neighborhood (Deutsch and Dormann, 2004) defined by l-cell-width to the left, right, front, back, above, and below. Let ϕi and ϕj be the fraction occupancy of i and j in the interaction neighborhood, respectively. The growth rate of the focal cell is ri=[ri0+rijϕj(1−ϕi)][1−χ(ϕi+ϕj)]. ri0 is the basal fitness (growth rate of i without any interactions); rijϕj(1−ϕi) represents the fitness effect on i by j, which increases with partner abundance and decreases with recipient abundance due to intra-population competition for partner; [1−χ(ϕi+ϕj)] reflects intra- and inter-population competition for shared resources with fitness decreasing as the neighborhood becomes more occupied. Cells were inoculated in the bottom surface of the simulation grid. In each simulation time step Δt, the probability of cell division is ri Δt. A cell would divide either to the side if there was space within its (x, y) planar confinement neighborhood of n-cell radius or upward otherwise (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Parameters used are listed in Figure 1—source data 1. χ = 0.8, l = 3, and n = 2 in all cases. See Source code 1 for an example (and Source code 4 for the MATLAB function)."

Since cell division and death occur at a time-scale much longer than diffusion and nutrient uptake, we used a multi-grid scheme in both space and time. In this model, a three-dimensional simulation domain consisted of cell grids representing individual cells and nutrient grids representing nutrient concentrations (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Cell actions and nutrient distributions were updated at discrete time steps over the simulation domain. Simulations were typically performed over an agarose domain of 0.75-mm length × 0.75-mm width × 24-mm depth and a community domain of 0.75-mm length × 0.75-mm width × 0.3-mm height with parameters listed in Figure 2—source data 1."

In equations (4) and (5), nu and nq are the number of consuming and releasing cells within the diffusion grid, respectively, KMM is the Michaelis-Menten constant for uptake, vm is the maximum uptake rate per cell, and ρ is the release rate per cell. To solve this diffusion equation, we used a finite difference time–domain method (Crank, 1980) with no-flow (∂S/∂z=0) boundary conditions applied to the top and bottom surfaces of the simulation domain and periodic boundary conditions applied to the four vertical sides of the domain."

Initially, each cell budded in the same plane and pushed others in its immediate neighborhood to the side. Once a cell was completely surrounded on each side by roughly five cells, it budded upward. The same process was implemented in the diffusion model (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It should be noted that by forcing the confined cells to bud strictly upward, the model underestimates intermixing. As a result, communities show more vertical features in simulations than experiments (Figure 2F)."

Spatially, cell actions took place on a cell grid with single-cell resolution (5 μm), while nutrient distributions were followed on a diffusion grid at lower spatial resolution (∼15 to 60 μm). These values were selected considering the trade-off between simulation time and accuracy, while ensuring the stability of simulations. For instance, at each time-step within a diffusion grid, the total amount of nutrients consumed should be considerably smaller than available nutrients. In other words, assuming that the length of a diffusion grid is nc where c is the length of a cell grid which is equivalent to the size of a cell, there are at most n3 cells in each diffusion grid and"

However, initial ratios below the critical value ϕG,c (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) will not converge to ϕG*. Other interactions ([∼ ∼], [∼ ↓], and [↓ ↓]) do not converge to a stable ratio. Similar conclusions on ratio convergence hold if we assume r^i=ri0+rijf(ϕj) for any continuous function f that monotonically increases with ϕj (proof not shown). Results are summarized in Table 1."

The studies are based on a previously developed system of two yeast strains that can enter cooperative interactions. The present paper deals with the development of a spatial patterning model in conjunction with a series of experiments that use different starting conditions to infer the stability of the observed patterns. The results of these experiments are then compared with the respective simulation results to validate the theoretical approach. This in turn is taken to infer further, more complex interactions in multi-partner systems. An additional experimental validation comes from the use of two bacterial species that interact on biochemically very different principles."

The main research question addressed is certainly significant, and the authors elegantly investigate it by using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches. There are no severe methodological problems that need to be addressed. However, there are some concerns about the generality of the findings. The current version reads in places as if general rules were derived; but, strictly speaking, they are only tested for systems with obligate cooperation. Also, the possibility of antagonistic interactions is not addressed at all. Still, it appears that the paper is a very strong starting point for future work into extended directions. Hence, we will by happy to offer publication in eLife, provided the following points are addressed in a revised version."

There are different forces that shape patterns of communities, one of which is the fitness effects of ecological interactions between populations. We show that if such fitness effects are responsible for community patterns, strong cooperation is the only type of interaction that leads to population intermixing. To make an analogy, species coexistence is not considered a limitation of the competitive exclusion principle. There are other forces that make species not compete for exactly the same resources, and the competitive exclusion principle provides a framework of expectations that allows us to recognize and study those forces. We do agree that the original discussions on forces that cause deviations from the ecological patterning expectations could benefit from being more explicit and organized. Thus, we have expanded and reorganized discussion into three subsections."

My expectations for such an experiment would be that with more ‘public goods’ added, the less tight the interaction gets and the less pronounced the population mixing will be. Such an outcome would further support the interpretation that the conclusions drawn do not apply to cooperative interactions within microbial communities in general, but be rather limited to obligate cooperative interactions.”"

      "content": "We have considered the experimental scheme proposed by the reviewer. However, we realized that if we supplement adenine and lysine to the agarose, the cells would simply exhaust the supplements first (competition) and then the interaction would switch to obligatory cooperation in addition to competition for other shared resources. One could argue that a steady supply of a very low concentration of adenine and lysine would create a facultative cooperative system, but there is no easy way of evenly supplying all cells in the community. In addition, any flow system would also wash out some of the released metabolites. To create bona fide facultative cooperation, we would need to either screen for natural microbes for facultative cooperation or create reduction-of-function (rather than loss-of-function) alleles in enzymes mediating adenine and lysine biosynthesis, and ideally these mutations should also be non-revertible. This would call for two genetic screens for appropriate mutations, which is beyond the scope of our study. Our fitness model predicts that in facultative cooperation, if for both partners the fitness benefits are large compared to the basal fitness, intermixing will increase rapidly as a function of community height (Figure 3B)."
