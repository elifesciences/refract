However, in many cases the relationship between the two variables is more complex, and it is not valid to say that one variable is independent and the other is dependent. When analysing such data researchers should consider plotting the three regression lines that can be calculated for any two-dimensional scatter plot."

In a typical analysis, data representing two variables are displayed in a two-dimensional scatter plot and the method of ordinary least squares is used to fit a regression line to the data. Here we examine an under-appreciated aspect of this approach: the slope of the regression line depends on which of the two variables we select as the independent variable. This means that the method of ordinary least squares can be used to calculate two different regression lines for the same scatter plot. While this issue has long been appreciated in the statistics community, it is not as widely known among biomedical researchers (Cornbleet and Gochman, 1979). The ubiquity of scatter plots and regression lines in biomedical research suggests that a brief discussion of this issue would be useful."

Alternatively, there may be an asymmetry in the relationship between the variables: for example, xi might represent the dose of an antihypertensive drug, and yi might represent the change in blood pressure in a group of subjects treated with various doses of the drug. In this example, drug dose is the independent variable and change in blood pressure is the dependent variable."

Thus, in the example described above one might be interested in predicting the change in blood pressure in response to different doses of the drug. However, there are many instances in which it is not clear that one variable depends on the other (independent) variable. For example, individuals with metabolic syndrome have elevated levels of both serum triglyceride and elevated fasting glucose levels: therefore, in a cohort that contains both metabolic syndrome patients and control subjects, one would expect these two variables to be correlated, with a clustering of metabolic syndrome patients at the high end of both distributions (Ford et al., 2002). Although it would be inappropriate to consider one of these variables independent and the other dependent in a mechanistic sense, one might still be interested in calculating the expected level of serum triglycerides given the level of fasting glucose, or the expected level of fasting glucose given the level of serum triglycerides. As described below, estimations in either direction begin with the calculation of a best-fitting regression line."

If one variable, conventionally represented by the y-axis, is known to depend on the other variable, conventionally represented by the x-axis, then one generally calculates a best-fitting line that represents the expected value of the dependent variable (y) as a function of the independent variable (x): this is known as the regression of y on x. In this case, the distance from a data point to the regression line (also known as the residual) is taken as the vertical distance from the point to the line (Figure 1A; Bulmer, 1965). This approach, referred to as ordinary least squares regression, is the default mode for line fitting in several commonly used software packages; for example, it is the algorithm represented by the ‘Trend line' and ‘Linest' functions in Microsoft Excel."

The best-fitting line calculated with perpendicular residuals will have an intermediate slope (Figure 1C). The data can also be described by a correlation coefficient (R) that is agnostic with respect to the dependence or independence of the variables (Bulmer, 1965). It is conventional to calculate the square of the correlation coefficient (R2), which is equal to the slope of the regression line for y on x (that is, calculated using vertical residuals) divided by the slope of the regression line for x on y (horizontal residuals). Thus, if the data points fall on a straight line (R2 = 1), the slopes of these two best-fitting lines will be equal. With increasing scatter in the data (R2 < 1), the slopes of the two best-fitting lines will diverge. If the data points are completely uncorrelated (R2 = 0), then the best-fitting lines calculated with vertical and horizontal residuals will have slopes of 0 and infinity, respectively."

In Ressler et al. the variables in the three scatter plots are: severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms vs. serum concentration of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP, also known as ADCYAP1; Figure 2A); severity of PTSD symptoms vs. PACAP receptor gene methylation (also known as ADCYAP1R; Figure 2B); and abundance of PACAP receptor mRNA in the cerebral cortex vs. abundance of PACAP mRNA in the cerebral cortex (Figure 2C). In this example, as in many biological systems, the cause and effect relationships between the variables are likely to be complex. For example, while it is possible that PACAP secretion may alter the severity of PTSD symptoms, it is also possible that stress associated with PTSD may alter PACAP secretion. Furthermore, it is possible that these two variables may have no direct cause-and-effect relationship, and that changes in neural circuitry alter stress level and PACAP secretion by distinct mechanisms. A similar argument can be applied to the other pairs of variables."

Plotting both regression lines gives a fuller picture of the data, and comparing their slopes provides a simple graphical assessment of the correlation coefficient. Plotting the orthogonal regression line (red) provides additional information because it makes no assumptions about the dependence or independence of the variables; as such, it appears to more accurately describe the trend in the data compared to either of the ordinary least squares regression lines."

In biological systems, where causal relationships between variables are often complex, deciding that one variable depends on the other may be somewhat arbitrary. Moreover, even when a causal chain appears to be well established mechanistically, feedback regulation at the molecular, cellular or organ system level can undermine simple models of dependence and independence. Therefore, we would like to suggest that unless the data analysis calls exclusively for a regression of y on x (or x on y), scatter plots should be presented with three best-fitting lines–calculated with horizontal, vertical and perpendicular residuals–to facilitate a more balanced assessment of trends in the data. Given the ubiquity of the ordinary least squares method in the analysis of two-dimensional scatter plots, this small change in the standard approach to data presentation should prove useful across the full range of biomedical sciences."
