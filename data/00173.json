We discovered membrane immersion allows substrates to be identified in a fundamentally-different way, based initially upon exposing ‘masked’ conformational dynamics of transmembrane segments rather than sequence-specific binding. EPR and CD spectroscopy revealed that the membrane restrains rhomboid gate and substrate conformation to limit proteolysis. True substrates evolved intrinsically-unstable transmembrane helices that both become unstructured when not supported by the membrane, and facilitate partitioning into the hydrophilic, active-site environment. Accordingly, manipulating substrate and gate dynamics in living cells shifted cleavage sites in a manner incompatible with extended sequence binding, but correlated with a membrane-and-helix-exit propensity scale. Moreover, cleavage of diverse non-substrates was provoked by single-residue changes that destabilize transmembrane helices. Membrane immersion thus bestows rhomboid proteases with the ability to identify substrates primarily based on reading their intrinsic transmembrane dynamics."

An important characteristic of proteases is that they are highly selective, only cutting proteins that contain well-defined sequences of amino acids in accessible regions. Proteases that are soluble in water have been studied for over a century and are now well understood, as are proteases that need to be tethered to the membrane of a cell to work properly."

However, given that intramembrane proteases evolved within the hydrophobic environment of the membrane, whereas soluble proteases evolved in an aqueous environment, there should there should also be significant differences between them. The best understood intramembrane proteases in terms of their biochemistry are probably the rhomboid proteases. However, most studies of their function have been performed in detergent systems rather than in real membranes."

Through a combination of biochemical and spectroscopic methods, they have discovered that rhomboid proteases identify the proteins they act on mainly by detecting changes in dynamic behavior: only those proteins that lose a stable helical structure when they exit the lipid phase to interact with the rhomboid protease will be cut by the rhomboid protease. Soluble proteases, on the other hand, achieve specificity by looking for proteins with a particular sequence of amino acids. The novel strategy used by rhomboid proteases allows them to patrol the membrane for unstable helices and selectively cut them. This discovery provides the first explanation of why these complicated enzymes evolved to have active sites immersed within the cell membrane."

Proteases are ubiquitous in all life, and are particularly well-adapted for serving as regulatory nodes in networks (López–Otín and Bond, 2008). These enzymes achieve their exquisite specificity by recognizing a short binding motif surrounding the scissile bond to align the substrate along the elongated active site cleft of the protease (Schechter, 2005). Residues flanking the scissile bond are designated P1 and P1′ on the amino and carboxy sides, respectively, and numbered moving outwards, while the accommodating protease subsites are correspondingly termed S1 and onwards. This geometric pairing confers high target specificity as the number of residues in the interaction increases, and results in a single and invariant substrate cleavage site (Schechter, 2005; Ng et al., 2009)."

      "content": "While soluble proteases have been attractive topics for study for over a century and are now understood at a sophisticated level (López–Otín and Bond, 2008), the more-recent discovery of intramembrane proteases uncovered a fundamentally separate path of protease evolution (Brown et al., 2000). These polytopic membrane proteins assemble a protease active site within the membrane using catalytic residues contributed by different transmembrane (TM) segments (Erez et al., 2009). Even more remarkable is the broad array of cellular networks that intramembrane proteases have come to regulate. Intensively studied is γ-secretase, an aspartyl intramembrane protease that releases signaling domains from the membrane, including the intracellular domains of the Notch receptor and the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) implicated in Alzheimer's disease (De Strooper et al., 1998, 1999; Wolfe et al., 1999). Homologous signal peptide peptidases function in immunity by liberating signaling domains of TNFα and FasL (Fluhrer et al., 2006; Friedmann et al., 2006; Kirkin et al., 2007). Site-2 proteases are metalloenzymes that release transcription factors from the membrane to regulate membrane biogenesis and stress responses in diverse organisms from bacterial pathogens to man (Rawson et al., 1997; Makinoshima and Glickman, 2005). Lastly, rhomboid proteases act as prime regulators of signaling in insects by activating EGF signals through proteolytic shedding (Urban et al., 2001, 2002), and play prominent functions in diverse pathogen signaling and adhesion (Urban, 2009)."

However, comparative approaches have been instructive only in highlighting convergent similarities in catalytic chemistry with soluble serine proteases (Vinothkumar et al., 2010); other properties of intramembrane proteases remain unexplored (Erez et al., 2009; Urban, 2010). Since these membrane-immersed proteases evolved within the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane, a fundamentally different environment compared to soluble proteases, could this novel environment confer different enzymatic properties? Particularly important is target specificity, because intramembrane cleavage is usually the signal-generating step that alone is sufficient for pathway activation (Brown et al., 2000)."

We therefore used biochemical and spectroscopic methods to determine the contribution of the membrane to proteolysis. These approaches revealed rhomboid proteases rely upon constraints imposed by the membrane on TM segment conformational dynamics to achieve high proteolytic specificity. Further interrogation of proteolysis directly in living cells suggest that rhomboid proteases expose the propensity of TM helices to exit the membrane and unwind as a substrate-discrimination mechanism, rather than relying on recognition-sequence binding like all other known specific proteases."

In fact, cleavage of the Drosophila EGF ligand Spitz always proceeded between the first two residues (AS) of its TM segment even with eight diverse rhomboid proteases and in bacterial, insect and human cells (and different organelles) that harbor lipid composition differences (Fast, 1966) (Figure 1A, also see Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Although Spitz is the most-studied rhomboid substrate, its cleavage site had never been mapped in cells."

The invariant cleavage site is denoted with a blue arrow in Spitz (first seven TM residues are shown).

Cleavage products isolated from N-Flag and C-Flag tagged APP + Spi7 substrates revealed the same cleavage sites with the expected relative proportions.

However, when we examined proteolysis in detergent micelles, we found that the cleavage site in Spitz also shifted +3 residues deeper into the TM segment (Figure 1B). The shift was even more dramatic with APP + Spi7, an engineered substrate that harbors seven TM residues of Spitz within the C-terminal 99 residues of human APP (Urban and Wolfe, 2005). In fact, some rhomboid enzymes abandoned the natural AS entirely in favor of cleavage +3 and/or +5 residues deeper (Figure 1B, also see Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). Without exception analyzing both N- and C-terminal cleavage products revealed that each substrate is cut only once in vitro without successive trimming, but the cut site is free to shift in position (Figure 1B, also see Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). Notably, small residues flanking the cleavage site (P1/P1′) were strongly preferred."

Reconstitution into proteoliposomes comprised of a wide variety of lipids all restored site-specificity (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), revealing that the composition of the membrane affects the efficiency of proteolysis, but not its site-specificity. Therefore, the uncompromising site-specificity of rhomboid proteases is not an inherent property of the enzyme itself, but rather results from the membrane somehow directing the position of cleavage."

Distal GA residues are a hallmark requirement for Spitz cleavage in cells (Urban and Freeman, 2003), and these residues were also important for cleavage in vitro when both rhomboid and substrate were reconstituted into proteoliposomes (Figure 1D). In contrast, cleavage of a GA mutant substrate was rescued to nearly wildtype levels in detergent micelles, suggesting that the membrane plays a direct role in restricting substrate specificity in addition to specifying the cleavage site."

      "content": "Since proteolysis in detergent was notably plastic, we investigated the protein dynamics of both the protease and substrates, neither of which have yet been studied for any intramembrane protease. We functionally identified TM5 of GlpG as part of the lateral gate for substrate access to the active site (Baker et al., 2007; Urban and Baker, 2008), although other models have also been proposed (Ha, 2009). Since cleavage sites shifted only deeper into the TM segment, we examined gate dynamics. We introduced a nitroxide spin label onto TM5 at W236, a position we previously identified to be key for gating, and onto the overlying extramembraneous Cap loop at M247 as a control. The particular W236 and M247 sites were also attractive because neither contribute to GlpG's structural stability (Baker and Urban, 2012). We then monitored dynamics directly at these sites using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. As expected, we observed two spectral components: a dynamic form (α in Figure 2A) and an immobilized form (β in Figure 2A). These are consistent with the gate-open and gate-closed conformations, respectively, observed by X-ray crystallography (reviewed in Urban, 2010). Interestingly, the relative proportion of these two forms changed when GlpG was in different environments. Both TM5 and Cap sites were readily observed in the highly-dynamic form when GlpG was in the detergent-solubilized state. However, while the Cap site retained a high proportion in the mobile form when GlpG was reconstituted into proteoliposomes (Figure 2B), the TM5 position shifted almost completely to the strongly restrained form (Figure 2A). This is consistent with conversion to a predominantly gate-closed form, indicating that the membrane confers site-specificity (Figure 1C) by restricting gate dynamics (Figure 2B)."

CD is a powerful tool for studying TM structure, but has never been applied to the analysis of intramembrane proteolysis. Interestingly, although distal helix-destabilizing residues were required for proteolysis in proteoliposomes, both wildtype and mutant TM peptides reconstituted into proteoliposomes formed helices of indistinguishable stability as revealed by overlapping ellipticity troughs at 208 and 222 nm (Figure 3A). Moreover, oriented CD analysis revealed comparable spectra for both wildtype and mutant TM peptides (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), suggesting that the tilt of the substrate and uncleavable TM segments in the membrane is similar. The knowledge-based Ez algorithm (Schramm et al., 2012) also failed to detect any tilt or structural differences between these wildtype and mutant TM segments."

This observation explains the relaxed need for helix-destabilizing residues for cleavage in detergent (Figure 1D), because these TM segments are already partly unwound. Moreover, we found that this instability is a defining feature of rhomboid substrates relative to non-substrates; analysis in detergent micelles revealed that the APP + Spi7 peptide was a remarkable 36% less helical than the non-substrate APP, while TatA was 46% less helical than its uncleavable GSP-VVL mutant (Figure 3B)."

This dynamic nature could allow substrates, but not non-substrates, to enter the catalytic center for proteolysis to ensue. While this model explains our biophysical observations, it's based entirely on in vitro measurements. We therefore sought to test the physiological, as well as functional, relevance of our model in living cells by examining its central predictions."

Substrate position should therefore be predictably shifted by moving, enhancing, or limiting intrinsic substrate dynamics. In contrast, if rhomboid achieves specificity by regimented binding of a recognition motif like soluble proteases, then the site of cleavage must necessarily be fixed, while altering TM dynamics should only change the efficiency of cleavage. We tested this prediction with Drosophila rhomboid-1 (DmRho1), the natural Spitz protease, and E. coli GlpG, the best understood rhomboid protease, under physiological conditions. To reveal substrate position in the active site at the time of catalysis we mapped substrate cleavage sites generated in living cells, since a protease:substrate complex structure has never been achieved."

Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that the two glycines dramatically decreased helical stability by >60% relative to wildtype Spitz (Figure 4A). Next, we tested Spitz + GG cleavage and found it to be cleaved more efficiently than wildtype Spitz in Drosophila cells, but the cleavage site shifted +3 residues (Figure 4B). The cleavage site also shifted in living E. coli cells by GlpG (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). This effect was not limited to glycine, since changing a distal cysteine (at P8′) to a helix-destabilizing serine also resulted in very efficient cleavage, but again induced a +3 residue shift in cleavage site (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). These shifts are particularly instructive because the natural sequence containing any possible binding motif is completely unperturbed, yet is abandoned for an ‘impermissible’ sequence (Strisovsky et al., 2009) with alanine and glycine at P4 and P2′, respectively (Figure 4C). Moreover, addition of helix-destabilizing residues at other positions could also induce shifts: mutating the P2′ isoleucine to glycine caused a +1 shift (Figure 4D)."

Indeed, all gate-open GlpG mutants (Baker et al., 2007; Urban and Baker, 2008) analyzed in living E. coli shifted the Spitz cleavage site +3 residues deeper into the TM segment (Figure 5A). The effect of these mutations is unlikely to be explained by interfering with any putative recognition-binding site on the protease, because all gate-open mutants, irrespective of position, resulted in cleavage site shifts (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). In fact, wildtype GlpG in detergent produced the same +3 and +5 cleavage sites as gate-open mutants (Figure 5C, also see Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), suggesting that, in the absence of the membrane, even the wildtype gate opens fully (which is also independently supported by EPR analysis)."

Gate-open mutants of GlpG analyzed in E. coli shifted cleavage site deeper into the Spitz TM segment (red). Cleavage of Spitz with helix-destabilizing S142 mutated to alanine by gate-open GlpG in E. coli cells produced a complete shift towards the top of the TM segment (blue). (B) Cleavage of Spitz with G143, and G143 + A144, mutated to leucine by gate-open GlpG in E. coli cells produced a gradual shift in cleavage site outwards. (C) Wildtype and gate-open (F153A + W236A) GlpG proteases produced identical, deeper cleavage sites when assayed in detergent micelles, indicating that the gate is fully open in the absence of the membrane. (D) Mutating the distal GA residues to LM also shifted the cleavage of APP + Spi7 in DDM detergent micelles to the natural AS site. Under these conditions the gate of wildtype GlpG is ‘open’ by virtue of the membrane being absent. (E) Diagram illustrating the ‘turn propensity’ effect of incorporating a helix-destabilizing/membrane-exiting residue (asterisk) into a long TM segment (Monné et al., 1999b). Lower diagram proposes an analogous effect for intramembrane proteolysis: residues of high ‘turn propensity’ could promote lateral substrate partitioning into the rhomboid active site. Right: change in turn propensity of substrate mutants plotted against the change in cleavage site occurring in natural membranes of living cells. (F) A hexapeptide encompassing the entire recognition motif (P4–P2′) of P. stuartii TatA, the most efficient rhomboid substrate, failed to block cleavage of two different substrates by any rhomboid tested in detergent or reconstituted liposomes (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2 for APP + Spi7 cleavage in liposomes and TatA cleavage in detergent). Black and green triangles denote substrate and cleavage product bands, respectively. The highest tested peptide concentration was 1 mM, while substrates were maintained at ≤1 μM."

Strikingly, the cleavage site of Spitz by gate-open GlpG in vivo shifted completely −3 residues when helix-destabilizing S142 alone was replaced by alanine (Figure 5A). Moreover, a partial −3 shift also occurred when we replaced G143 with leucine, and almost fully to the outer AS when both GA residues were replaced with leucine (Figure 5B). A shift also occurred with Drosophila rhomboid-1 (Figure 4D). Importantly, we observed the same shifts with mutant substrates and wildtype GlpG in detergent micelles, in which the gate is open by virtue of the membrane being absent (Figure 5D). Therefore, even when the gate is open, helix-destabilizing residues are required for substrates to enter rhomboid's active site."

To evaluate further what physical property is most likely responsible for the effects on proteolysis, we searched for a correlation between cleavage site shifts in living cells vs changes that our mutants made in residue properties using several independently generated physical scales. We found the strongest correlation with a ‘TM turn propensity’ scale (Monné et al., 1999a, 1999b). This scale had been derived by placing guest residues into the center of a long TM segment and measuring whether the residue prefers to stay in the middle of the membrane in the TM helix, or moves outside the membrane in a turn that breaks the long TM helix into two shorter TM helices (Figure 5E). The quantified propensity scale displayed a correlation coefficient of 0.86 with the direction and degree of cleavage site shifts that we observed with 12 mutant substrates cleaved by rhomboid proteases in cellular membranes (Figure 5E)."

The new cleavage sites further revealed dramatic re-alignments of the substrate in the rhomboid active site (Figure 4C), even when the natural putative recognition was unperturbed, such that stereotypical binding of a complementary recognition sequence between rhomboid and substrates is unlikely to be the main driving force for protease specificity. But to evaluate this further, we examined the ability of the proposed P4–P2′ recognition binding region of TatA, the most efficient bacterial substrate, to inhibit proteolysis competitively by a panel of bacterial rhomboid enzymes in vitro both in detergent micelles and reconstituted into proteoliposomes. Even at millimolar concentration (∼1000× the substrate concentration), the peptide did not block rhomboid proteolysis of TatA or APP + Spi7 substrates (Figure 5F and Figure 5—figure supplement 2), independently suggesting that sequence-specific binding is not the main feature of rhomboid specificity."

      "content": "Discovering rhomboid specificity is driven by exposing intrinsic TM dynamics raised an independent prediction: non-substrates of various sequence should be converted into substrates simply by increasing their intrinsic TM dynamics. APP, Delta and TGFα have been characterized genetically, cell biologically, and in vitro with pure proteins as non-substrates for rhomboid enzymes (Peschon et al., 1998; Urban and Freeman, 2003; Lemberg et al., 2005; Urban and Wolfe, 2005; Adrain et al., 2011). We reasoned that incorporating a single proline, which has the highest helix-and-membrane exit propensity of all residues (Monné et al., 1999a, 1999b), might increase their intrinsic TM dynamics. Indeed, CD analysis revealed that incorporating a single proline into the TM of APP was sufficient to decrease TM helix stability by over twofold (Figure 6A). Remarkably, installing single prolines alone was sufficient to convert APP, Delta and TGFα into efficient rhomboid substrates in vivo and in vitro (Figure 6B,C). In fact, intramembrane cleavage become so efficient that in all cases it outcompeted the natural juxtamembrane cleavage by metalloproteases, and in the case of Delta, little unprocessed full-length protein could be detected. Cleavage was dependent on rhomboid activity, because it required the catalytic serine of both Drosophila and human rhomboid proteases, and γ-secretase inhibition did not affect cleavage (Figure 6—figure supplement 1)."

This may reflect influence by neighboring sequence context on overall helical stability and/or propensity to partition into the active site (Li et al., 1996; Yang et al., 1997). Intriguingly, the relative cleavage site preference was dependent on the position of the proline, and moved deeper as the proline position descended into the TM segment (Figure 6D). These observations provide compelling evidence that simple changes in intrinsic TM dynamics under physiological conditions drive substrate specificity for membrane-immersed proteolysis."

Substrates form a stable helix only in the membrane; partial exposure to the aqueous environment within rhomboid triggers an entropy-driven conformational switch, facilitated by helix-destabilizing residues, allowing substrates to reach the catalytic residues (in orange). Bottom panel depicts a non-substrate:rhomboid complex, in which the TM segment maintains a stable helix and therefore cannot reach the catalytic residues. The non-substrate TM segment eventually dissociates without being cleaved (far right). Induction of efficient non-substrate cleavage suggests that the initial docking interaction between rhomboid and TMs is non-specific. The exact order of events, and what triggers each step, remain speculative. Membrane thinning surrounding GlpG as observed in molecular dynamics simulations is illustrated (Bondar et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2012), although its functional consequence remains unclear. Structures 2IC8 (closed GlpG), 2NRF (open GlpG), 1MOX (Spitz-EGF), and 2TGF (TGFα-EGF) were used to diagram the model."

Coupling this information with examining proteolysis in living cells suggests that the main factor keeping many type I TM segments from becoming rhomboid substrates is their ability to maintain a stable TM helix. Differences between substrate and non-substrate TM helices are minimal while they reside in the membrane. However, a defining property of rhomboid substrates is a meta-stable TM helix that actually relies on the membrane for stability, and unravels without it. Mutations that stabilize TM helices compromise proteolysis, while simply introducing helical instability into non-substrate TMs, as measured directly by CD, converted three of three unrelated type I membrane proteins into substrates for seven different rhomboid proteases despite diversity in the cleaved sequences."

      "content": "It is worth emphasizing that mutational analysis has played an important role in our study of rhomboid proteolysis, and while this is a proven strategy for elucidating enzyme mechanisms, all of our mutants that change helicity also necessarily change sequence. To limit this inherent drawback, we were careful, whenever possible, to make conservative mutations, measure effects on helicity directly by CD, and ultimately base our analysis on >30 mutations. Nevertheless, we further evaluated what underlying physical property drives the cleavage site shifts and ultimately found the strongest correlation with a ‘turn propensity’ scale. The informative feature of this novel scale is that it integrates both the helical propensity of a residue, as well as its preference to be inside the membrane versus seeking a more hydrophilic environment (Monné et al., 1999a, 1999b). As such, the intrinsic dynamics in rhomboid substrate TMs thus likely derives from a combination of residues that destabilize the TM helix structure directly, as well as those of limited hydrophobicity that increase the likelihood of this polypeptide region escaping the helix-inducing environment of the membrane (in favor of the hydrophilic active site of rhomboid, see below). This observation independently suggests that the key differences in TM dynamics are evaluated in a different, non-membranous environment. This may explain why alanines are known to be important for rhomboid proteolysis yet themselves are not helix-destabilizing directly, and require mutation to large hydrophobic residues to compromise proteolysis."

However, it should be noted that our analysis had the benefit of quantifying ‘changes’ in turn propensity (‘∆ turn propensity’ in Figure 5E) between two sequences that differ at only one or two residues. In practice, the turn propensity of a residue has been shown to be altered in non-linear ways by differences in TM segment length, the local sequence context, and the exact position of the residue within the TM segment (Monné et al., 1999b). If these confounding parameters also apply to rhomboid proteolysis, accurately predicting absolute propensities of natural TM segments from sequence alone may present challenges. Nevertheless, cautious optimism is warranted, since these challenges could be overcome by additional scale refinement with rhomboid proteases directly."

The shifts that we observed reveal sequence requirements for proteolysis with positive data, because they mark substrate position in the active site at the time that catalysis was proceeding efficiently. Preference for cleavage to shift to between small residues re-affirmed prior studies (Urban and Freeman, 2003; Akiyama and Maegawa, 2007). However, little appears to be essential for cleavage beyond small P1/P1′ residues, since we found a great diversity of residues at other positions allowed efficient proteolysis to proceed by multiple rhomboid proteases. This is particularly informative, because prior analyses necessarily focused on mutations that block cleavage, but could not rule out the possibility that they interfere with proteolysis indirectly, for example, by promoting TM oligomerization (which is required for TatA function)."

Nevertheless it is important to note that this too does not mean that any TM sequence can become a rhomboid substrate. Rather, it highlights that the natural sequence diversity in many TM segments provides ample opportunities for finding acceptable cleavage sites. True substrates would nevertheless be expected to have further sequence optimization that would be specific to a particular rhomboid protease, because greater proteolytic efficiency would be favored as substrate and protease co-evolve. One current example might be TatA proteolysis, because TatA cleavage is thought to proceed rapidly and automatically for quorum sensing to operate (Stevenson et al., 2007). However, this is unlikely to be representative of most rhomboid functions. Even so, a peptide comprised of all P4–P2′ residues requires millimolar concentrations to affect proteolysis of TatA by AarA, indicating that even in this context recognition sequence binding is not the main determinant for specificity."

      "content": "Considered together, our observations suggest a new working model in which canonical rhomboid proteases patrol the membrane for meta-stable TM helices for cleavage. A gate-open rhomboid may be sufficient to provide a microenvironment in which ‘intrinsic’ TM segment differences can be unmasked, and recent molecular dynamics simulations and biophysical measurements indicate that this is a stable rhomboid conformation in the membrane (Baker and Urban, 2012; Zhou et al., 2012). Because of both helix-destabilizing residues and limited hydrophobicity, substrates are poised to exit from the membrane and partition into the hydrophilic rhomboid active site. Proteolysis then ensues because such extended TMs are susceptible to proteolysis, and/or are able to ‘reach’ the internal catalytic apparatus. Such substrate ‘partitioning’ is consistent with a strong correlation with a ‘turn propensity scale’, and may further explain the unexpected observation that scanning a single proline along the TM segment moves the cleavage site deeper, at times positioning it at unacceptable residues. Importantly, the central yet overlooked component of this specificity system is the membrane itself, which limits proteolysis both by inducing TMs to form helices and restricting gate-opening (Figure 7)."

Moreover, structural analysis of the rhomboid-substrate complex is required to define the fine-detail interactions that mediate proteolysis, although this might prove particularly challenging if true substrates are indeed intrinsically dynamic.

Yet dozens of examples reveal that simply anchoring a protease domain to the membrane through a TM segment satisfies these needs (Blobel et al., 2009; Antalis et al., 2010). So why did complicated, membrane-immersed enzymes evolve and become so wide-spread across all forms of life? Our analyses indicate that rhomboid proteases achieve substrate specificity first through reading TM dynamics, which endows them with different properties relative to soluble proteases. Intramembrane proteases might therefore be a distinct group of enzymes in the cell, not because they are proteases that release proteins from the membrane, but because they are membrane-immersed; they live in a world with different rules, giving the cell a set of enzymes with unique properties that it can harness for evolving new functions."

Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (Wu et al., 2006), and labeled with 250 μM MTSL (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada). Free probe was removed by gel filtration chromatography, followed by NiNTA affinity chromatography and washing for 2–3 days at room temperature. X-band EPR spectra of samples in 0.9-mm quartz capillaries were recorded at 37°C (310 K) on a Bruker EMXmicro spectrometer equipped with a PremiumX ultra low noise microwave bridge, a high-sensitivity ER4119HS resonator, and an ER4141VT temperature control unit (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA). Spectra were background corrected and subtracted, and normalized by the absolute number of spins in each sample as quantified by double integration using Xenon software (Eaton et al., 2010)."

Peptides were electrophoresed on 16% tricine gels to verify concentration and lack of aggregation, while peptides reconstituted into proteoliposomes were further examined by ultracentrifugation. Ellipticity and UV absorbance at 205 nm (to quantify peptide concentration accurately during scanning) were measured simultaneously at 25°C through a 0.2 mm path length cuvette in a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD). Analyses were conducted by averaging 10 scans at 50 nm/min, background was determined and subtracted, and mean residue ellipticity was calculated."
