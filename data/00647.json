As the animal traverses a spatial trajectory, individual locations along the trajectory activate these neurons in a unique firing sequence, which yields a memory code representing the trajectory. How this type of memory code is altered in dementia-producing neurodegenerative disorders is unknown. Here we show that in transgenic rTg4510 mice, a model of tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal neurons did not fire at specific locations, yet displayed robust firing sequences as animals run along familiar or novel trajectories. The sequences seen on the trajectories also appeared during free exploration of open spaces. The spatially dissociated firing sequences suggest that hippocampal neurons in the transgenic mice are not primarily driven by external space but by internally generated brain activities. We propose that tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration renders hippocampal circuits overwhelmed by internal information and therefore prevents them from encoding spatial memories."

This happens because the neurons in those areas of the brain where memories are processed are dying. Indeed, by the time Alzheimer's disease has been diagnosed, many of the neurons in these regions have already died. The symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are then produced by the remaining neurons. However, the reasons why the remaining neurons cannot make new memories are unknown."

They found that the neurons were activated almost everywhere, which indicates that the hippocampal neurons in transgenic mice are no longer working as place cells. However, these neurons were still activated one by one in robust sequences. Moreover, the sequences generated by the transgenic mice were the same in many different surroundings, which suggests that these sequences are not memory codes of the animal's current surroundings. Cheng and Ji propose that the sequences reflect existing memories already stored in the brain, which would suggest that Alzheimer's patients cannot form new memories because the brain is preoccupied by old memories, and thus fails to store the new information that is coming in from the outside world."

A current challenge is how to bridge between these two very different aspects of AD. Because memory deficits are necessarily produced by the memory-processing neural circuits in vivo (Dickerson and Eichenbaum, 2010), a key step toward this challenge is to understand the functional alterations in the memory circuits, including the hippocampus (HP), of the living brain with ongoing pathogenesis. Both the β-amyloid and tau pathologies are likely involved in the memory loss (Chapman et al., 1999; Yu et al., 2001; Cacucci et al., 2008; Ashe and Zahs, 2010; Palop and Mucke, 2010). In particular, tau pathology and subsequent neurodegeneration play a key role in mediating the memory symptoms seen at a mature stage of AD (Ashe and Zahs, 2010). Currently, it is unknown how the mnemonic functions of HP are altered by tau pathology in vivo."

      "content": "One well-studied function of HP in vivo is the coding of spatial memories. It is believed that spatial memories in both rodents and humans are encoded by HP place cells that fire at one or a few specific locations of a given space (place fields) (O’Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; Wilson and McNaughton, 1993; Burgess and O'Keefe, 2003; Ekstrom et al., 2003). When the animal runs along a novel spatial trajectory, external sensory input at individual locations along the trajectory drives place cells to fire one after another in a unique sequence, which yields a memory code for the trajectory (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993; Harris et al., 2003; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006). After the novel experience, the sequence becomes internally established and can be reactivated during later memory recall and/or consolidation with or without partial external input (Buzsaki, 1989; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994; Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996; Nadasdy et al., 1999; Lee and Wilson, 2002; Foster and Wilson, 2006; Diba and Buzsaki, 2007; Ji and Wilson, 2007; Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008; Davidson et al., 2009; Karlsson and Frank, 2009; Carr et al., 2011). Therefore, in theory, on any given trajectory HP could either retrieve stored internal sequences, form new ones, or combine both, based on the external input that HP receives from the environment. It has been proposed that the interplay between internal and external inputs is important to memory processing in HP and abnormal interaction may lead to memory interference and/or intrusion (Nakazawa et al., 2002; McHugh et al., 2007; Colgin et al., 2008)."

To this end, we set out to examine the spatial memory code in the transgenic rTg4510 (Tau) mouse. This model was chosen because its well-characterized pathological and behavioral phenotypes mimic many key features of tau pathology in AD (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005; Berger et al., 2007). In Tau mice, the overexpression of a mutated version (P301L) of the human tau gene restricted in the forebrain leads to age-dependent spatial memory deficits, tau neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal loss. In this study, we recorded neurons in the CA1 region of HP using the tetrode recording technique (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993; Buzsaki, 2004; Ji and Wilson, 2007) from 7 to 9 month old Tau mice and their control littermates while they performed spatial navigation tasks. We found that HP neurons in Tau mice fail to fire at specific spatial locations and yet maintain robust firing sequences, suggesting that non-spatial, internal brain activities dominate the HP circuits and prevent them encoding external space."

      "content": "As expected, WT neurons fired spikes at stable, specific locations in every lap that the animal traversed a trajectory. In contrast, spikes of Tau neurons were not confined to specific locations (Figure 2B). Close visual inspections revealed that Tau neurons’ spikes were still specific to one or a few locations in each individual lap, but the locations were changed from lap to lap (Figure 2B). We described a neuron’s firing profile on a trajectory by a rate curve (the two trajectories were analyzed separately for each neuron), which was the neuron’s firing rate as a function of the position along the trajectory. The rate curve was computed for every lap and then averaged across all laps. Whereas the averaged rate curves of typical WT neurons clearly showed one or a few peaks indicative of well-defined place fields, those of typical Tau neurons did not show such prominent peaks (Figure 2B, ‘bottom curves’). We quantified the location-specificity using spatial information (SI) (Skaggs et al., 1993). SI was computed for each neuron active on each trajectory at two levels, a lap SI to measure the location-specificity at individual lap level and a trajectory SI to measure the overall location-specificity across all laps based on its averaged rate curve. The median lap SI of WT neurons was only slightly (21%) greater than that of Tau neurons (Figure 2C; WT 2.03 [1.00 3.09] bits/spike, N = 263; Tau 1.68 [0.84 2.34] bits/spike, N = 262; p=7.7 × 10−11), but the median trajectory SI of WT neurons was much greater (180%) than that of Tau neurons (Figure 2D; WT: 1.29 [0.55 2.61] bits/spike; Tau: 0.46 [0.15 1.29] bits/spike; p=5.3 × 10−39). We also quantified the lap-to-lap location change by rate-stability, defined as the average correlation coefficient between any two laps’ rate curves. Tau neurons showed much lower rate-stability than WT neurons (Figure 2E; WT: 0.66 [0.30 0.86]; Tau: 0.075 [0.0042 0.34]; p=1.7 × 10−70). These results reveal that Tau neurons lost their overall location-specificity, mainly due to unstable firing locations."

      "content": "(A) First, we assigned letter identities (bold letters) to cells active on a trajectory. Spike raster of six WT and five Tau cells (same as those in Figure 3A) during a single running lap are plotted in time. Vertical lines: start and end times of the laps. (B and C) Second, we determined whether pairs of cells had stable firing relationships based on the stability of their cross-correlations (CCs). For examples, the CCs of a pair of WT (cell G and cell I in A) and a pair of Tau cells (cell A and cell H in A) are shown in (B). Each panel shows the color-coded CC for every lap and the bottom curve shows the lap-averaged CC. The color bar is shared by all panels in (B) and (C). For every lap, a CC was generated by cross-correlating the two cells' binned firing rates (bin size: 100 ms) in the lap. Note the stable peak locations of the lap CCs and the prominent peak of the lap-averaged CC for both the WT and Tau pairs in (B). For each cell pair, we computed a CC-stability, defined as the average correlation-coefficient between any two laps' CCs. To evaluate the significance of the CC-stability, we also computed a shuffled version of CCs (C) after the two cells' firing rates were circularly slid with independent, random time intervals (slide-shuffling). Note the inconsistent peaks in the lap CCs of both the WT and Tau pairs and consequently small CC-stability values in (C). For each cell pair, we generated 1000 shuffled CCs by slide-shuffling and therefore obtained 1000 chance level CC-stability values. A cell pair was considered to have a stable CC if (1) CC-stability is greater than the upper 1% of the chance level (p<0.01) and (2) there was a peak in the lap-averaged CC (the maximum value of the Z-transformed CC ≥ 1). Third, we ordered the cells in those pairs with a stable CC. For the pairs in (B), because the peak of the lap-averaged CC between cell G and I occurred at a negative time lag (*), we ordered the pair as IG. Because the peak between cell A and H occurred at a positive time lag (*), we ordered the pair as AH. If the peak of a pair occurred at exactly time lag 0, we randomly ordered the cells in the pair. (D) Finally, we constructed template sequences that agreed with all the ordered pairs (see ‘Materials and methods’). The derived template sequences for the WT (XIGQOZ) and Tau (FABHD) cells are shown. Spike raster of the cells, ordered according to the templates, are displayed in the time domain during the same five laps as in Figure 3A. Note the repeated occurrence of the template sequences across laps. This also shows that firing sequences of WT and Tau cells in the time domain were very similar to that in the space domain (Figure 3A)."

Here we show how the spike pattern was searched through to find matches with the template sequence. First, the spike trains of the five cells (top) were transformed into instantaneous firing rate curves (bottom) using a Gaussian kernel (σ = 1 s) (Ji and Wilson, 2007). The local maxima of the temporal rate curves greater than a threshold (here was the mean rate of a cell in the entire running session) were detected (ticks). Boxes: detected matches. (C) Second, the detected local maxima of all the cells were ordered into a raw sequence according to their times. Now the spike pattern was translated into a long raw sequence. Boxes: segments of the raw sequence that matched with the template sequence, as determined below. (D) Third, we searched through the raw sequence to find the segments that match with the template sequence. A match was defined by a significant rank order correlation. For example, given a segment FFAHBBD, we determined a rank for each letter according to its order in the template (template rank) and a rank according to its time (time rank). The correlation coefficient of the two ranks was computed and its significance was assessed by using 1000 random shuffles of the letters in the segment (shuffle p). In pilot computations, we found that the p value determined from Pearson's R (p=0.0103 for this example) was a close approximation of shuffle p (0.0095 for this example). To save computing time, we later used a threshold (p<0.05) on the Pearson's p value to define matches."

(A and B) First, the template sequences were generated by using a threshold to select pairs of cells with consistently high correlations. How did the sequence detection result depend on the particular threshold chosen? The number of templates (A) and mean number of detected sequences (in Z-score) (B) on familiar trajectories in WT (black) and Tau (red) mice were computed using a wide range of cell selection threshold (0.05–0.4). Arrows: actual thresholds (black: WT, red: Tau). Different actual thresholds were used for WT and Tau mice because the thresholds were computed from chance-level correlations (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), which differed between WT and Tau cell pairs. Dashed horizontal lines: actual Z-scores at the actual thresholds. *p<0.05 from the actual Z-scores. The Z-scores changed very slowly as the threshold was decreased. Only when the threshold became extremely low (<0.08), did the Z-scores drop significantly. (C) Second, Tau cells fired more broadly on the track, which might have increased temporal overlap in their firing patterns and yield more opportunities for sequence detection. Were the Z-scores sensitive to the possible overlapped firing of Tau cells? To address this, we systematically down-sampled the spike trains during trajectory running and re-computed the Z-scores. We binned spikes of each cell into 1-s long bins and removed spikes within randomly chosen bins. This manipulation reduced the temporal overlap among cells at a time scale of our sequence detection. The result is plotted similarly as in (B). It is clear that the actual Z-scores were insensitive to the down-sampling. Only when more than 60% spikes removed, did Z-scores start to drop significantly below the actual values. Therefore, although the absolute number of detected sequences on the track inevitably depended on the exact parameters chosen, the normalization (Z-scoring relative to the chance level) in our sequence detection method resulted in a robust quantification of the sequential structure in the multicell spiking patterns."

      "content": "To quantitatively demonstrate this, we analyzed the high-order (≥4 neurons) firing sequences (Lee and Wilson, 2002; Ji and Wilson, 2007) of WT/Tau neurons on the familiar track. We first assigned letter identities to those neurons active on a trajectory. We arranged pairs of neurons according to their firing orders identified by their cross-correlations. We then derived a template sequence for the trajectory that agreed with all the ordered pairs. For example, for the five Tau neurons shown in Figure 3A, the cross-correlation between the second (assigned as neuron A) and the fourth (neuron H) had a positive peak at 0.8 s. We ordered them as AH. By ordering all pairs among the five neurons in this manner, we derived a template sequence FABHD for this trajectory. A total of 13 template sequences were derived from WT mice and 8 from Tau mice (Table 2). For a template sequence on a trajectory, we then detected the firing sequences in the spiking patterns of all laps that matched with the template. To evaluate the significance of the detection, we generated 1000 shuffled copies of the spike patterns by randomly swapping neuron identities and then detected the number of sequences in each copy. The number of detected sequences in the real spike patterns was expressed as a Z-score computed from the mean and standard deviation of the shuffling-generated counts. We found a significant number of detected sequences for 9 out of the 13 WT templates and 6 of the 8 Tau templates (p<0.05, Z-test; Table 2). The mean (±SEM) Z-scores for all WT and all Tau templates were similarly high (Figure 3B; WT: 2.5 ± 0.3; Tau: 2.3 ± 0.3; p=0.67, one tailed t-test, same below unless specified otherwise). Both WT and Tau template sequences were detected in almost every lap (Figure 3A). Although it appeared that Tau sequences occurred more frequently than WT sequences in a given lap (Figure 3A), this difference was not significant (Figure 3C; WT: 1.0 ± 0.1 times per lap; Tau: 1.4 ± 0.3 times per lap; p=0.10). These results show that Tau neurons, like WT neurons, formed robust firing sequences."

The median firing rate of these Tau neurons was lower than that of WT neurons (WT 1.3 [0.5 3.8] Hz, Tau 0.9 [0.5 2.7] Hz, p=0.0001), which would predict a greater location-specificity of Tau neurons. However, we observed the opposite. As illustrated by their rate maps (Figure 4B), firing rate color-plotted at each position of the two dimensional (2D) open box, firing activities of Tau neurons covered a much larger portion of the box (meaning less location-specific) than those of WT neurons. The location-specificity in the box was quantified by SI in the 2D open space (open SI) for each neuron active in each open box session. The median open SI of WT neurons was significantly greater than that of Tau neurons (Figure 4C; WT: 0.24 [0.04 0.76], N = 131; Tau: 0.11 [0.04 0.34], N = 119; p=1.9 × 10−7). The result indicates that Tau neurons fired with low location-specificity in the familiar open box."

Because of the random nature of the free exploration behavior, unlike the repeated trajectory running on the track, we did not expect repetitive high-order firing sequences to appear in the open box. However, when we arranged the neurons according to their firing orders in the template sequences derived during track running, it became apparent that Tau neuron sequences, but not WT sequences, during the track running also appeared frequently during the open box sessions (Figure 5A). We quantified this observation by searching through the spike patterns of open box sessions for sequences that matched with the trajectory template sequences. Here we refer ‘a search’ as to matching one open box session to one trajectory template. We found a significant number of sequences in 10 out of the 16 searches in Tau mice, whereas only in 2 of the 24 searches in WT mice (p<0.05, Z-test; Table 2). The mean Z-score of all searches in Tau mice was significantly higher than that in WT mice (Figure 5B; WT: −0.1 ± 0.3; Tau: 1.4 ± 0.4; p=0.001). Therefore, Tau sequences, but not WT sequences, seen on the track trajectories also appeared robustly during the open box sessions."

To examine this possibility, we plotted the animal’s paths between the start and end times of all detected Tau sequences in a search. These paths appeared to be randomly distributed in the box (Figure 5C), suggesting that the detected sequences were not linked to particular locations or a particular path. To quantitatively demonstrate this, we drew a vector from the start to the end location of each path. We then plotted all the vectors resulted from a search with their starting positions aligned at the origin (Figure 5D). If the paths were not randomly distributed, the vectors should show a preferred direction. However, the vectors of a typical search were randomly orientated (Figure 5D). For each search in Tau mice where a significant number of sequences were found, we computed a Rayleigh p value, which tested a null hypothesis that the vectors had no preferred direction. None of the p values for all the 10 searches was significant (Figure 5E, p≥0.07), indicating that the null hypothesis could not be rejected. Therefore, the detected Tau sequences in open box sessions were not due to repetitive running behavior. Together with the low location-specificity of Tau neurons in the open box sessions (Figure 4), we concluded that Tau sequences seen in the open box were not primarily driven by spatial locations. Even further, these Tau sequences seen in the open box were the same as those during the track running. Therefore, Tau sequences did not distinguish two completely different spaces during two very different behaviors. This is a striking result given the well-known phenomenon of ‘remapping’ of place cell activities between different environments (Muller and Kubie, 1987; Leutgeb et al., 2005; Colgin et al., 2008)."

      "content": "On the novel track (Figure 6A), 79 WT neurons and 92 tau neurons were active on at least one of its trajectories. Their median firing rates during the novel track running sessions were not significantly different (WT: 1.4 [0.4 2.7] Hz, Tau: 1.1 [0.4 3.3] Hz, p=0.71). Whereas the firing locations of WT neurons became stabilized quickly on the novel trajectories, those of Tau neurons stayed unstable from lap to lap (Figure 6B). As a result, the median trajectory SI of Tau neurons was much lower than that of WT neurons (WT 0.69 [0.23 1.5] bits/spike, Tau 0.28 [0.086 0.68] bits/spike, p=5.9 ×1 0−31), despite a similar median lap SI (WT 1.2 [0.58 1.8] bits/spike, Tau 1.2 [0.46 1.6] bits/spike, p=0.62). The rate-stability of Tau neurons was much lower than that of WT neurons (WT 0.47 [0.17 0.85], Tau 0.10 [0.03 0.28], p=1.6 × 10−51). In the novel open box (Figure 6C), 74 WT neurons and 61 Tau neurons were active in at least one session. The median firing rates of these WT and Tau neurons during the novel box sessions were not significantly different (WT: 1.1 [0.4 2.9] Hz, Tau: 1.0 [0.5 2.6] Hz, p=0.38). The rate maps of Tau neurons showed much broader firing areas than those of WT neurons (Figure 6D), suggesting a reduced location-specificity in Tau neurons. This was confirmed by the result that the median open SI of Tau neurons was significantly lower than that of WT neurons (WT: 0.28 [0.06 0.71] Hz, Tau: 0.08 [0.02 0.32] Hz, p=1.3 × 10−12). These results show that Tau neurons fired with little location-specificity either on the novel trajectories or in the novel open box."

But unlike WT neuron sequences, Tau sequences on the novel trajectories were not anchored to specific locations (Figure 6E) and same sequences also appeared in the novel open box sessions (Figure 6F). We derived 15 high-order template sequences on the novel trajectories from WT mice and 8 from Tau mice (Table 3). The mean Z-scores of WT and Tau template sequences on the novel trajectories were similarly high (Figure 6G, WT: 2.5 ± 0.2, Tau: 2.4 ± 0.4, p=0.91), but the mean location shift of Tau sequences among laps was greater than that of WT ones (Figure 6H; WT: 9.2 ± 0.9 cm, Tau: 18.5 ± 3.6 cm, p=0.0038). The mean location shift values of both WT and Tau sequences shown here were smaller than those on the familiar track, probably due to the shorter length of the novel track. Finally, Tau template sequences were detected in the novel open box sessions significantly more often than WT templates (Figure 6I, mean Z-scores: WT: 0.5 ± 0.2, N = 30 searches; Tau: 1.5 ± 0.3, N = 12; p=0.0029). Here we emphasize that the novel open box sessions preceded the novel track running. Therefore, Tau sequences seen on the novel trajectories were already preexistent in the prior open box sessions. These findings suggest that the formation of Tau sequences did not primarily depend on spatial experience in an environment."

To answer this, we first examined whether the firing locations of Tau neurons were completely random. Visual inspection of the lap-by-lap spike trains of Tau neurons revealed that the firing locations of Tau neurons were often consistent among a few laps on both the familiar (Figure 2B) and novel (Figure 6B) trajectories, suggesting that the locations were not completely random. Indeed, randomly sliding rate curves of individual laps further significantly reduced the median rate-stability of Tau neurons on both familiar (−0.0020 [−0.034 0.042], p=9.3 × 10−49 compared with actual rate-stability) and novel (−0.0020 [−0.032 0.049], p=1.8 × 10−60) trajectories, indicating that spatial locations still modulated Tau neurons’ firing activities."

      "content": "Second, we examined whether Tau neuron sequences were trajectory-selective. On both the familiar and novel tracks, most animals ran two different trajectories (back and forth between two food wells) in each of the two running sessions. For each template sequence derived on a trajectory in a session, we counted the occurrence of the sequence (in Z-scores) not only on the trajectory itself (Self), but also on the same trajectory (ST) in the other session and on the other trajectory (OT) in the same session. On the familiar track, the mean Z-scores of Self and ST were similar for both WT (Self 2.5 ± 0.3, N = 13 templates; ST 2.3 ± 0.2, N = 13; p=0.53) and Tau (Self 2.3 ± 0.3, N = 8; ST 1.6 ± 0.5, N = 8; p=0.27) sequences, but there was a significant difference between Self and OT for both WT (OT 0.29 ± 0.3, N = 13; p=5.8 × 10−6) and Tau (OT 0.10 ± 0.2, N = 8; p=6.1 × 10−5) sequences (Figure 7A). The result shows that Tau sequences, like WT sequences, occurred consistently on same trajectories across different sessions and distinguished between different trajectories within same sessions. On the novel track, whereas the mean Z-scores of Self and ST remain comparable for both WT (Self 2.5 ± 0.2, N = 15; ST 1.7 ± 0.3, N = 15; p=0.06) and Tau (Self 2.4 ± 0.4, N = 8; ST 2.6 ± 0.6, N = 4; p=0.79) sequences, there was a significant difference between Self and OT only for WT (OT −0.26 ± 0.2, N = 15; p=3.0 × 10−9), but not for Tau (OT 1.9 ± 0.5, N = 8; p=0.51) sequences (Figure 7B), suggesting that Tau sequences, unlike WT sequences, did not distinguish the two trajectories on the novel track. This analysis shows that Tau sequences were originally not trajectory-selective on the novel track, but became so on the familiar track. Therefore, although Tau neuron’s firing activities were not location-specific and Tau sequences were not primarily driven by space, there was still a modulation of Tau neuron’s firing activities by spatial experience and spatial trajectory."

For all the sequences matched with a template in a session, we visualized the spatial/temporal gaps between neighboring sequences by a raster plot and computed the spatial/temporal auto-correlogram of the sequences using their locations/times to examine the periodicity (Figure 8). Neighboring WT sequences in track sessions displayed a consistent spatial gap and there were periodic peaks in their spatial auto-correlograms (Figure 8A, left). The spatial period was the same as the track length (∼2 m for the familiar track, ∼1 m for the novel track), which was expected, given the repetitively running of same track trajectories. The periodicity was much less obvious in the temporal domain (Figure 8A, right), because the amount of time that animals spent running and at the food sites varied from lap to lap. In contrast, Tau sequences during track sessions did not show any consistent spatial or temporal gaps in their raster plots and no obvious, periodic peaks were observed in either the spatial or temporal auto-correlograms (Figure 8B). The spatial periodicity at the track length disappeared apparently because Tau sequences were not anchored to track locations. The average auto-correlogram across all sessions confirmed this observation on both the familiar and novel tracks (Figure 8C,D). Using the same analysis, Tau sequences in open box sessions did not show apparent spatial or temporal periodicity either (Figure 8B,E). Therefore, there was no strong evidence for a periodic occurrence of Tau sequences."

The histogram of this raster plot is equivalent to the auto-correlogram of the sequence locations/times (bottom). The auto correlation value at 0 was truncated. Note the regular intervals in the spatial raster plot and periodic peaks in the spatial auto-correlogram. (B) Same as (A), but for the sequences matched with a template during a track session (Track) and an open box session (Open) of a Tau mouse.

      "content": "We have shown the existence of robust Tau sequences that were not anchored to specific locations and even did not distinguish different environments. Is it possible that these sequences were produced simply by some peculiar behaviors of Tau mice? Track running and free exploration of open boxes are simple behavioral tasks that both WT and Tau mice were able to perform. Figure 9A,B show the accumulative running paths and linearized individual laps of a WT and Tau mouse on the familiar rectangular track. Figure 9C shows the accumulative running paths of the same mice in the familiar open box. As seen in these raw plots, the overall behavior of the WT and Tau mouse was similar. We then quantified the behavior using the following parameters. The first, most straightforward parameter is the running speed during the running of a track trajectory or during an open box session. In addition, for each trajectory of a track, we measured the animal’s performance by the number of laps on the trajectory and quantified the quality of the running by computing the cumulative travel distance per lap, the number of stops (defined as speed <4 cm/s lasting ≥2 s) per lap, and the stopping duration per lap. These parameters were computed for 54 familiar (WT: 22, Tau: 32) and 46 novel (WT: 20, Tau: 26) trajectories and 27 familiar (WT: 11, Tau: 16) and 25 novel (WT: 12, Tau: 13) open box sessions. The results are shown in Figure 9D–H. On familiar trajectories, Tau mice completed less number of laps and ran with a slower speed than WT mice, but their running quality as measured by stopping and travel distance was similar. On novel trajectories, Tau mice behaved similarly as WT mice or even better on one measure (less number of stops per lap). In open boxes, Tau mice in general ran slightly faster than WT mice, but the difference was significant only in the novel open box. Since robust Tau sequences were found on both the familiar and novel tracks and these sequences appeared in both the familiar and novel open boxes, it is unlikely that the running behavior per se was responsible for the differences between WT and Tau sequences."

We next asked whether theta oscillations were altered in Tau mice. As seen in Figure 10A, the raw and filtered LFP traces of a Tau mouse appeared similar to those of a WT mouse, except that the overall magnitude of the Tau mouse’s LFPs was reduced, which is expected because of the massive neurodegeneration. Power spectral density (PSD) analysis of the raw traces showed a clear peak within the theta band in the LFP PSDs of both mice, but with a reduced amplitude in the Tau mouse’s (Figure 10B, left). However, when the PSD values were normalized by the total LFP power, the peak of the Tau mouse’s PSD was comparable with that of the WT mouse (Figure 10B, right), indicating the presence of prominent theta oscillations in the LFPs of the Tau mouse."

These parameters were compared among WT, Tau, and mice of two other control genotypes (+/−, −/+, see ‘Materials and methods’), which showed no obvious tau-mediated neurodegeneration in CA1 (Figure 1 and Table 1). There was a slight reduction in theta peak frequency in Tau mice (∼8.5 Hz, compared with ∼9.5 Hz in control mice) during familiar track and open box sessions. This difference became even less obvious in novel sessions (Figure 10C). The absolute theta power was apparently reduced in Tau mice from those of control animals (Figure 10D). However, the normalized theta power in Tau mice was significantly lower than that in control mice only during familiar track sessions, but not during open box sessions or novel track sessions (Figure 10E). We also restricted this analysis on LFPs within the start and end times of detected sequences in WT and Tau mice. The observation was similar (Figure 10F–H). Therefore, although LFPs in Tau mice were overall smaller, prominent theta oscillations were still present and qualitatively similar to those of WT mice, suggesting that abnormal theta oscillation is unlikely the cause of the difference between Tau and WT sequences."

Rather than the sequence-related parameters, we used the rate-stability on track trajectories for this purpose because it allowed the comparison between male and female mice with sufficient samples (Figure 11A,B). Between those neurons recorded from male and those from female WT mice, there was no significant difference in the mean rate-stability either on familiar (male 0.70 [0.33 0.88], female 0.65 [0.29 0.86], p=0.21) or novel (male 0.54 [0.19 0.83], 0.46 [0.16 0.86], p=0.22) trajectories. Between those from male and female Tau mice, the mean rate-stability was similar on novel trajectories (male 0.10 [0.023 0.26], female 0.10 [0.037 0.31], p=0.51). But on the familiar trajectories, the mean rate-stability of the neurons from female Tau mice was significantly greater than that of male Tau mice (male 0.047 [−0.0035 0.14], female 0.13 [0.031 0.42], p=5.5 × 10−16). For both genders and on both the familiar and novel trajectories, the mean rate-stability of WT neurons was always much greater than that of Tau neurons (p≤1.3 × 10−14). These results indicate that the firing stability of CA1 neurons was severely compromised in Tau mice of both genders, but CA1 neurons in female Tau mice did better on familiar trajectories than those in male Tau mice."

Our data show that CA1 neurons in the transgenic mice do not fire at specific locations, but still form robust firing sequences. These sequences are not anchored to precise locations of spatial trajectories and do not even distinguish between two very different spatial environments. The sequences seen on novel trajectories already exist in a prior session of free exploration in an open box. Therefore, CA1 firing sequences in the transgenic mice become so rigid that they no longer primarily respond to spatial environments or spatial experience, and therefore no longer capable of encoding spatial memories."

      "content": "The lack of both spatial specificity and experience-dependence indicates that external spatial input in Tau mice is incapable of taking control of Tau neurons. Nevertheless, Tau neurons do not fall into disorganized firing patterns, but fire with robust sequences. If not external space, what could be the driven force that assembles Tau neurons into these sequences? It has been recently shown that internal brain activities, those related to memory recall (Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008; Pastalkova et al., 2008) and those encoding time (MacDonald et al., 2011; Eichenbaum, 2013), can produce CA1 firing sequences similar to those shown here. Therefore, here we propose that internal activities underlie the rigid firing sequences in the transgenic mice. On the other hand, although the firing activities of CA1 neurons in the transgenic mice were not location-specific, they are still modulated by external space and spatial experience (Figure 7). The existence of this external modulation together with the rigid firing sequences paint a picture of ‘cued false activation’. When the transgenic mice are placed in a space, instead of forming/retrieving the space's memory code, CA1 neurons are cued to activate those internally driven activity patterns irrelevant to the current space. According to this interpretation, the reason why these mice cannot form new spatial memories is because the HP network is dominated by internal brain activities."

      "content": "This interpretation implies that there exists a direct competition between external and internal inputs in HP. Therefore, our data provide evidence that abnormal external-internal interaction may contribute to memory deficits in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous studies have shown that CA1 firing sequences can occur during immobility (Foster and Wilson, 2006; Diba and Buzsaki, 2007; Davidson et al., 2009; Karlsson and Frank, 2009; Carr et al., 2011) or when the animal is spatially restricted (Pastalkova et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2011). These sequences are believed to be internally generated because external spatial input stays stationary in these situations. In our experiments, the animals’ paths between the start and end times of Tau sequences spanned a distance on the tracks (Figures 3A and 6E) and in the open boxes (Figure 5C), clearly showing that the animals were moving when Tau sequences occurred. The sequences also occurred in accompany with prominent theta oscillations (Figure 10A,H). Therefore, the non-spatially driven firing sequences were found even when animals were actively moving through space. In this case, the external spatial input associated with the movement is overtaken by internal input in the control of CA1 neurons’ firing activities. This further extends the recent findings that pre-existing neuronal sequences may influence future memory codes (Gupta et al., 2010; Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2011)."

      "content": "What changes in the neural circuits of Tau mice could produce the abnormal completion between internal and external input? Internal activities could originate in CA3, an area where neurons can drive each other via its extensive recurrent connections (Lisman, 1999; Nakazawa et al., 2002). External sensory input reaches CA1 likely through the direct pathway via the entorhinal cortex. In Tau mice, there is evidence that tau pathology starts earlier in the cortex including the entorhinal cortex than in HP, and within HP, neuronal loss is more prominent in CA1 than in CA3 (Ramsden et al., 2005). It is likely that the external input to CA1 through the entorhinal cortex is weakened by the pathology, but the internal input from CA3 is relatively spared. In the entorhinal cortex, grid cells fire spikes in a spatially periodic fashion (Hafting et al., 2005). In our data, although Tau sequences sometimes occurred repeatedly in a running lap, there was no evidence for either spatial or temporal periodicity in Tau sequences (Figure 8). Also Tau cells’ firing activities were not tied to specific locations on the tracks (Figure 2B) and did not show obvious periodic patterns in the open boxes (Figure 4B). Therefore, Tau sequences are unlikely resulted from periodic firing of entorhinal grid cells. Other potentially relevant changes in Tau mice could include interneurons and theta oscillations, since they greatly shape the firing activities of HP place cells (O’Keefe and Recce, 1993; Skaggs et al., 1996; Buzsaki, 2002; Dragoi and Buzsaki, 2006). In Tau mice, the CamKII gene that induces tau pathology and neurodegeneration is not expressed in interneurons and thus should mainly affect pyramidal neurons in HP (Mayford et al., 1996; Sik et al., 1998; Ramsden et al., 2005). However, interneurons could still die or alter their properties as adaptive changes to the tau pathology and loss of pyramidal neurons. In our datasets, we only recorded 11 putative interneurons from WT mice and 12 from Tau mice. There was a trend that Tau interneurons fired with a lower rate than WT ones (WT: 24.2 [11.7 46.7] Hz, Tau: 14.8 [8.8 27.2] Hz, p=0.05). This rate change could be one of the adaptive changes in Tau mice to keep the overall activity of remaining HP pyramidal neurons at normal level. Regarding theta oscillations, although the medium septum, the structure important for theta generation in HP, could be affected by tau pathology, based on the known expression pattern of CamKII (Odeh et al., 2011), our data show that prominent theta oscillations are still present in the CA1 LFPs of Tau mice. In particular, the proportion of theta power in the total LFP power is in many cases similar between WT and Tau mice (Figure 10E,H). Therefore, theta oscillation unlikely plays a major role in the generation of abnormal Tau sequences. Based on these considerations, we propose that the internal input from CA3, by winning over the external input via the direct pathway from the entorhinal cortex, is the main driving force for producing the rigid Tau sequences. As such, Tau sequences mainly reflect the internal information such as old memories stored in the CA3 recurrent connections."

      "content": "Our data reveal a subtle but significant difference between male and female Tau mice: The firing stability of CA1 neurons on familiar trajectories in female is greater than that in male mice. This is somewhat unexpected, given a previous report that female tau mice show higher level of abnormally phosphorylated tau and worse performance in the Morris water maze task (MWM) than male mice (Yue et al., 2011). Other previous studies on another tau-related mouse model have found more extensive β-amyloid, but not tau, pathology (Hirata-Fukae et al., 2008) and more severe impairments on MWM in females than in males (Clinton et al., 2007). One possible explanation for the discrepancy is the age of animals used in our study. The sex difference of Tau mice was previously examined at 5.5 months old (Yue et al., 2011). At much older ages (7–9 months) as in our study, tau pathology becomes much more extensive and possibly saturated and thus the sex difference may become less significant (Ramsden et al., 2005). Another possibility is that tau pathology may not only affect spatial memory representation, but also other factors important for MWM. For example, it has been proposed that behavioral testing produces more stress in females than males and thus greater behavioral deficits under pathological conditions (Clinton et al., 2007). In our experiments, the animals had been handled for at least 1 month (for tetrode adjustment and maze training) before recordings began. The mice in our study might have a reduced level of stress, which exposed the subtle advantage of females in the firing stability of CA1 cells. This advantage in females could be compensated by a stronger stress response to MWM, producing an overall greater impairment on task performance."

Our recordings were conducted on the transgenic mice at 7–9 month old, which is a late, mature stage of tau pathology that displays all typical pathological features including hyperphosphorylated tau, tau tangles, and neurodegeneration (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). Previous experiments show that stopping the production of the transgenic tau is sufficient to halt the memory deficits at the behavioral level (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005), pointing to a role of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein itself. Another possibility is that neurodegeneration reduces the neuron number in HP and cortex and result in a limited capacity for memory storage. Future studies on tauopathy models at various pathological stages may uncover the exact features of tau pathology and/or neurodegeneration that cause the observed abnormalities. Nevertheless, the current study allows us to identify the functional alterations of CA1 neurons at a mature stage of tau pathology and lay the foundation for probing their pathological causes."

      "content": "Currently, no animal models can fully recapitulate the pathological changes in human AD patients (Ashe and Zahs, 2010). The limitation in the animal model calls for caution in applying the finding to the human disease. However, tau pathology is a key feature of AD (Wenk, 2003; Ashe and Zahs, 2010) and plays a key role in its behavioral phenotypes (Ashe and Zahs, 2010). This model does mimic key features of human tauopathy including its age-dependent progression (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). The functional changes at the cellular level in HP identified in this animal model, such as the low location-specificity and rigid firing sequences, possibly also occur in the human brain with similar tau pathological features. Interestingly, our interpretation that internally generated activities obstruct the formation of new memories is consistent with two typical memory symptoms seen in AD patients: the inability to form new memories (Carlesimo and Oscar-Berman, 1992; Salmon and Bondi, 2009) and the intrusion of old memories (Butters et al., 1987; De Anna et al., 2008). This illustrates that studying the functional changes in memory circuits of animal models can generate novel insight into the memory symptoms of human neurodegenerative diseases including AD."

The activator, bred in a 129S6 background strain, carried the tTA transgene under the CaMKIIa promoter. The responder, bred in the FVB/N strain, carried a transgene encoding the human four-repeat tau with the P301L mutation (hTauP301L). The F1 offspring of the two mouse lines that carries both the hTauP301L and tTA transgenes (hTau+/tTA+, Tau mice) has been shown to overexpress the human tau in the forebrain and display age-dependent progression of tau pathology and neurodegeneration in the hippocampus (HP) and the cortex (Ramsden et al., 2005; Santacruz et al., 2005). The animals used in this study were Tau mice, their wildtype (hTau−/tTA−, WT) littermates, and littermates with the other two control genotypes, hTau+/tTA− (+/−) and hTau−/tTA+ (−/+), all at 7–9 month old (Table 1).

The rate xi at the i-th bin or i-th grid was the number of spikes divided by the total time the animal spent at the bin/grid (occupancy time, ti). Then, SI was (Skaggs et al., 1993),"

For example, if eight neurons were active, we assigned them to A B C D E F G H. Then, we determined whether any pairs of neurons had a stable CC and if so, we used their CC peak times to order the neurons within the pairs (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for details). Next, we derived a sequence that agreed with all the ordered pairs. For example, if ordered pairs were found to be AB, FA, BH, BD, HD, we arrived at a sequence FABHD. However, it was not always as straightforward as this, because of the following complications. (1) Sometimes contradictory orders, for example AB, BC, CA occurred, due to the noisy nature of spike trains, especially when multiple neurons fired close in time. (2) There were often many undetermined orders, because not all pairs were found to have a stable CC. This resulted in too much freedom in template sequences and too many different sequences could agree with the ordered pairs to the same degree (as defined below)."

Therefore, we expressed the number of detected sequences (n) as a Z-score relative to the chance-level, determined by the following shuffling procedure (Ji and Wilson, 2007). We randomly shuffled the neurons’ identities and generated 1000 copies of shuffled spike patterns. For each copy, we counted the number of sequences matched with the template. We computed the mean (m) and standard deviation (σ) of the counts for all the copies. The Z-score of n is Z = (n − m)/σ. The number n was considered significant if Z > 1.645 (corresponding to p<0.05, Z-test). This Z-score normalization was a robust measurement of number of sequences, insensitive to the particular choice of a key parameter in the template generation process (Figure 3—figure supplement 4)."

We treated the times (distances) of all the sequences in a session as a ‘spike’ train and computed its binned rates [x1, x2, …, xN] with a temporal (spatial) bin size of 2 s (4 cm). The auto-correlation was computed using Equation [3] with two identical vectors (xi = yi, i = 1, 2, … N). The auto-correlogram (auto-correlations plotted against time/space lags) was only computed for those templates or open box sessions that yielded significant number of detected sequences (Z-score > 1.645, p<0.05, Z-test)."

The absolute theta power was the integration of PSD values within the theta band (6–12 Hz). This frequency range was chosen because most PSDs in our data showed a peak centered at 8–10 Hz and spanning this range. The PSD values were normalized by the total power at frequencies >2 Hz. The power at ≤2 Hz was not included in the normalization because it was sensitive to the animal’s movement artifacts. The normalized theta power was the integration of the normalized PSD values within 6–12 Hz. The analysis was also performed on LFPs restricted within the start and end times of identified firing sequences."
