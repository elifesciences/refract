In metazoa, distinct stress conditions activate different eIF2α kinases (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that converge on phosphorylating a unique serine in eIF2α. This collection of signaling pathways is termed the ‘integrated stress response’ (ISR). eIF2α phosphorylation diminishes protein synthesis, while allowing preferential translation of some mRNAs. Starting with a cell-based screen for inhibitors of PERK signaling, we identified a small molecule, named ISRIB, that potently (IC50 = 5 nM) reverses the effects of eIF2α phosphorylation. ISRIB reduces the viability of cells subjected to PERK-activation by chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress. eIF2α phosphorylation is implicated in memory consolidation. Remarkably, ISRIB-treated mice display significant enhancement in spatial and fear-associated learning. Thus, memory consolidation is inherently limited by the ISR, and ISRIB releases this brake. As such, ISRIB promises to contribute to our understanding and treatment of cognitive disorders."

Upon phosphorylation of its α-subunit, eIF2 becomes a competitive inhibitor of its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), eIF2B (Hinnebusch and Lorsch, 2012). The tight and non-productive binding of phosphorylated eIF2 to eIF2B prevents loading of the eIF2 complex with GTP thus blocking ternary complex formation and reducing translation initiation (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001). Because eIF2B is less abundant than eIF2, phosphorylation of only a small fraction of the total eIF2 has a dramatic impact on eIF2B activity in cells."

      "content": "One of the eIF2α kinases, PERK, lies at the intersection of the ISR and the unfolded protein response (UPR) that maintains homeostasis of protein folding in the ER (Pavitt and Ron, 2012). The UPR is activated by unfolded or misfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER lumen because of an imbalance between protein folding load and protein folding capacity, a condition known as ‘ER stress’. In mammals, the UPR is comprised of three signaling branches mediated by ER-localized transmembrane sensors, PERK, IRE1, and ATF6. These sensor proteins detect the accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and transmit the information across the ER membrane, initiating unique signaling pathways that converge in the activation of an extensive transcriptional response, which ultimately results in ER expansion (Ron and Walter, 2007). The lumenal stress-sensing domains of PERK and IRE1 are homologous and likely activated in analogous ways by direct binding to unfolded peptides (Gardner and Walter, 2011). This binding event leads to oligomerization and trans-autophosphorylation of their cytosolic kinase domains, and, for PERK, phosphorylation of its only known substrate, eIF2α. In this way, PERK activation results in a quick reduction in the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER-lumen (Harding et al., 2000)."

To this end, we constructed a retroviral vector containing the open-reading frame of firefly luciferase fused to the 5′UTR of ATF4 mRNA (Figure 1A), which contains two short open-reading frames (uORFs) that control ATF4 translation in a stress-dependent manner. After infection, we established a HEK293T cell line harboring the stably integrated reporter. We used thapsigargin, a potent ER stressor that inhibits the ER calcium pump, to activate PERK and induce eIF2α phosphorylation. Thapsigargin treatment resulted in a 4.9-fold induction in luciferase activity in a 384 well format with a Z factor of 0.5 (Figure 1B). This format was used to screen 106,281 compounds covering a wide chemical space. We identified 460 hits (0.43%) (Figure 1C), which were further validated in an 8-point dose-response assay using the same reporter. We further triaged the compounds by discarding inhibitors that also affected the IRE1 branch of the UPR using a luciferase-based XBP1 splicing reporter. Less than half (187 hits) of our initial hits proved unique to the PERK branch. We next used an orthogonal secondary screen that employed a different reporter (bi-cistronic ATF4-dGFP-IRES-mCherry) stably integrated into a different cell line (U2OS cells). The read-out of this latter screen was microscopy-based, which allowed us to simultaneously assess acute toxicity by cell counting, further reducing the number of viable hits to 77 (data not shown). As a tertiary screen, we tested compounds for their ability to inhibit ER stress-elicited induction of endogenous ATF4 by Western blot analysis. Twenty-eight compounds passed this test and were analyzed further."

HEK293T stably expressing the ATF4 luciferase reporter were plated in 384-well plates and treated for 6 hr with 100 nM thapsigargin (Tg) or DMSO as a no ER stress control. Luciferase production was measured at the end point after 6 hr (mean ± SD). The Z′ was calculated as 1−(3 [σ Tg + σ DMSO]/[μ Tg–μ DMSO]). (C) Primary screen results. The ATF4 luciferase reporter cell line was treated for 6 hr with 100 nM thapsigargin and library compounds (10 µM). Inhibition of the luciferase activity reporter was calculated as the percent reduction in relative luminescence normalized to thapsigargin treatment (0% inhibition) and the no-ER stress control (100% inhibition). Compounds were considered hits if they lied beyond three standard deviations (SD) from the thapsigargin treatment mean (red line)."

This compound (henceforth referred to as ‘ISRIB’ for Integrated Stress Response inhibitor) is a symmetric bis-glycolamide, containing a central bi-substituted cyclohexane, and can exist as two diastereomers, cis and trans (Figure 2A). We synthesized both isomers and tested their ability to inhibit the ATF4-luciferase reporter (Figure 2B). Trans-ISRIB proved 100-fold more potent (IC50 = 5 nM) than cis-ISRIB (IC50 = 600 nM), indicating that the compound’s interaction with its cellular target is stereospecific. Given the two-order-of-magnitude difference in activity in this assay, the measured activity of cis-ISRIB may be an over-estimate, as we cannot exclude a small contamination with trans-ISRIB, which is far more potent. The lower IC50 of trans-ISRIB relative to the compound in the small molecule library indicates that the library likely contains a mixture of the two stereoisomers. All further experiments in this study were carried out with the synthesized trans-isomer of ISRIB."

PERK phosphorylation is indicative of its activation by autophosphorylation and can be recognized by reduced mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Notably, ISRIB did not inhibit the mobility shift of PERK observed in ER-stressed cells (Figure 2C). Rather, we observed an exaggerated mobility shift, indicative of increased phosphorylation of PERK upon ER stress, induced by either thapsigargin or tunicamycin (an inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation). In each case, in the absence of ISRIB, ATF4 and XBP1s were produced upon ER stress induction. In agreement with the behavior of the reporters described above, ISRIB blocked production of endogenous ATF4, whereas XBP1 mRNA splicing (Figure 2D) and XBP1s production persisted (Figure 2C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As shown below (Figure 5D), ISRIB also did not affect activation of the ATF6-branch of the UPR. We conclude that ISRIB specifically blocks signaling of the PERK-branch of the UPR."

We measured the levels of phosphorylated eIF2α using an antiphospho-eIF2α antibody-based assay to quantify phosphorylation at serine 51 (see ‘Materials and methods’). Upon induction of ER stress by tunicamycin or thapsigargin, phosphorylation of eIF2α increased over time, reaching a fourfold and sevenfold increase after 120 min respectively (Figure 3A). Unexpectedly, ISRIB did not block eIF2α phosphorylation under either of these ER stress-inducing conditions. On the contrary, 120 min after tunicamycin addition, ISRIB further increased the level of eIF2α phosphorylation, approaching that obtained with thapsigargin. ISRIB alone had no effect on eIF2α phosphorylation. These results indicate that ISRIB blocks effects downstream of PERK and eIF2α phosphorylation."

      "content": "(A) ISRIB does not block eIF2α phosphorylation upon ER stress. eIF2α phosphorylation was measured using an alpha-screen Surefire eIF2α p-S51 assay (see ‘Materials and methods’). U2OS cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with 2 µg/ml tunicamycin or 100 nM thapsigargin in the presence or absence of 100 nM ISRIB for the indicated times or with ISRIB alone for 120 m (N = 4, mean ± SD). See Figure 3—figure supplement 1 for supporting Western blot analysis of eIF2α phosphorylation. (B) ISRIB blocks global translational attenuation observed after eIF2α phosphorylation during ER stress. HEK293T cells were treated with 100 nM thapsigargin and 200 nM ISRIB for either 1 or 3 hr prior to a 20 min pulse with 35S methionine before lysis. Equal amounts of lysate were loaded on an SDS-PAGE gel and quantification of radiolabeled methionine incorporation of lysates was done by gel densitometry (N = 2, SD) using ImageJ. (see Figure 3—figure supplement 2 for SDS-PAGE). (C) Polysome gradient analysis showing the block in global translational attenuation upon addition of ISRIB on ER-stressed cells. MEFs were grown in the presence or absence of 2 µg/ml of tunicamycin with or without 200 nM ISRIB for 1 hr. Cell lysates were loaded on a 10–50% sucrose gradient, centrifuged at 150,000×g for 2.4 hr and absorbance at 254 nm was measured across the gradient (see Figure 3—figure supplement 3 for quantitation of polysome profile). A representative experiment is shown (N = 3). See Figure 3—figure supplement 4 for a close-up of the disome and trisome peaks. (D) Cells treated with ISRIB are resistant to the global translational attenuation exerted by forced expression of eIF2α(S51D). HEK293Trex cells were transduced with a tetracycline inducible phospho-mimetic (S51D) allele of eIF2α. Transgene expression was induced by addition of 25 nM doxycycline for 14 hr in the presence or absence of 200 nM ISRIB. Lysates were collected and analyzed as described in panel (C) (see Figure 3—figure supplement 6 for quantitation of polysome profile). A representative experiment is shown (N = 2). (E) ISRIB does not reverse global translational attenuation exerted through inhibition of CAP-dependent initiation. Wild-type MEFs were treated with 750 nM Torin-1 in the presence or absence of 200 nM ISRIB for 2 hr. Lysates were collected and analyzed as described in panel (C). A representative experiment is shown (N = 2). (F) ISRIB blocks production of ATF4 upon GCN2 or HRI activation. An immunoblot analysis of PERK, ATF4 and total eIF2α in HEK293T cells starved for cysteine and methionine or treated with an HRI activator (6 µM) for 5 hr in the presence or absence of 200 nM ISRIB is shown. Tunicamycin was used as a positive control for induction of ATF4 and the shift in PERK mobility. Under amino acid starvation we consistently observe a partial reduction of ATF4 production by ISRIB by Western blot analysis but observe a complete block in induction of the ATF4 luciferase reporter (see Figure 3—figure supplement 7)."

In agreement with this notion, ISRIB sustained global translation (as monitored by 35S-methionine incorporation into newly synthesized polypeptides) even in the presence of ER stress (Figure 3B). After thapsigargin treatment, cells experienced a 40% drop in translation, which was abolished by ISRIB. As predicted by this result, extracts prepared from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) experiencing ER stress showed a pronounced increase in the 80S monosomes at the expense of polyribosomes (Figure 3C), which was reversed (at least partially) by addition of ISRIB. We chose MEFs for this analysis because they show stronger translational inhibition in response to ER stress than HEK293T cells. ISRIB was the only molecule in our collection of 28 hits that reversed translational attenuation upon ER-stress."

The presence of PICs on an mRNA can be detected as ‘halfmer’ peaks on polysome gradients. In the gradients shown in Figure 3C, addition of a PIC to disomes and trisomes was well resolved (enlarged in Figure 3—figure supplement 4). Upon eIF2α phosphorylation in ER-stressed cells, the reduction in PIC resulted in disappearance of the halfmer population. As expected, the disappearance of the halfmer peak upon ER-stress was dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation as no reduction was observed in MEFs that solely express non-phosphorylatable eIF2α(S51A) (Figure 3—figure supplement 5). Importantly, ISRIB partially restored the halfmer population in ER-stressed cells, providing support to the notion that it helps maintain high PIC levels even when eIF2α is phosphorylated (Figure 3—figure supplement 4). These data indicate that ISRIB exerts its function by maintaining elevated ternary complex levels."

Expression of this allele upon doxycycline addition induced translational attenuation (Figure 3D) as seen by an increase in the 80S peak and a decrease in the polysome population. ISRIB rescued translation returning it to the levels observed in non-induced cells. In conclusion, ISRIB restores translation in cells containing either phospho-eIF2α or eIF2α(S51D), thereby excluding any pleiotropic effects that might have been caused by the reagents used to activate ER stress."

To this end we used Torin-1, an inhibitor of mTOR that blocks phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and S6K1, and leads to translational attenuation (Thoreen et al., 2012). Addition of Torin-1 to MEFs led to an increase in the 80S peak and reduction in the polysome population to a similar extent as shown above in cells treated with ER stressors or expressing eIF2α(S51D) (Figure 3E, compare with Figure 3C,D). In contrast to these treatments, addition of ISRIB did not reverse the effect of Torin-1 on translation. Therefore, the ability of ISRIB to block translational attenuation is specific to eIF2α phosphorylation."

To test this prediction, we subjected cells to amino acid starvation, which activates the eIF2α kinase GCN2 and leads to ATF4 production. In addition, we used a recently identified small molecule activator to induce eIF2α phosphorylation by activating HRI, another eIF2α kinase (Chen et al., 2011). As expected, ISRIB blocked ATF4 induction after activation of either GCN2 or HRI (Figure 3F). Under both conditions, PERK was not activated as shown by a lack of mobility shift. These data suggest that ISRIB is a bona fide ISR inhibitor that blocks signaling downstream of all eIF2α kinases."

As shown in Figure 4A, GADD34 and CHOP mRNAs accumulated in ER-stressed U2OS cells, and ISRIB significantly reduced their induction. In agreement, we observed no CHOP accumulation after induction of ER stress in ISRIB-treated cells (Figure 4B). Thus ISRIB impairs the transcriptional network governed by ATF4 during the ISR."

This indicates that events downstream of eIF2α phosphorylation are required to resolve the stress. As shown in Figure 5A, ISRIB treatment of wild-type cells had similar consequences. Importantly, addition of ISRIB alone did not affect cell viability, as judged by the number of colonies that form after acute treatment. By contrast, ISRIB addition caused a strong synergistic effect on ER-stressed cells, reducing colony number and size significantly more than ER-stress alone. This reduction in cell survival resulted from activation of apoptosis as the activity of the executioner caspases 3 and/or 7 was significantly induced under these conditions (Figure 5B; Salvesen and Ashkenazi, 2011)."

First, as shown in Figure 2C, PERK was hyper-phosphorylated. Second, cells expressing an IRE1-GFP fusion protein showed prolonged foci formation (Figure 5C), indicative of IRE1 oligomerization. Third, we observed prolonged ER stress-induced proteolytic processing of ATF6 (Figure 5D). Importantly, in the absence of ER stress ISRIB treatment alone did not induce any of these sensors (Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 5C and data not shown)."

Based on these observations, we wondered whether treatment of mice with ISRIB would affect memory. ISRIB showed favorable properties in pharmacokinetic profiling experiments indicating sufficient bioavailability for in vivo studies. ISRIB displayed a half-life in plasma of 8 hr (Figure 6A) and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier, quickly equilibrating with the central nervous system (Figure 6B). After a single intraperitoneal injection, we detected ISRIB in the brain of mice at concentrations several fold higher than its IC50 (24 hr after injection, the ISRIB concentration in the brain was approximately 60 nM). To explore ISRIB's effects on memory, we injected mice intraperitoneally with ISRIB and tested hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. To this end, we trained mice in a Morris water maze, in which animals learn to associate visual cues with the location of a submerged hidden platform. Because we were looking for memory enhancement, we used a weak training protocol. As shown in Figure 6C, ISRIB-treated mice reached the hidden platform significantly faster (escape latency after 5 days of training = 16.4 ± 4.8 s) compared to vehicle treated controls (68.1 ± 20 s, p<0.05). The difference was already pronounced by days 3 and 4. In agreement with these results, ISRIB-treated mice significantly preferred the target quadrant in a ‘probe test’ conducted at the end of the training sessions, in which the platform was removed from the pool (p<0.05; Figure 6D) and showed increased crossing of the platform location (p<0.05; Figure 6E)."

In this case the context acts as the ‘conditioned stimulus, CS’ and is associated with the foot shock, the ‘unconditioned stimulus, US’.

ISRIB is the first reported antagonist of the ISR. It acts as a potent and stereospecific inhibitor with an IC50 of 5 nM in cultured cells, suggesting a specific and tight interaction with its cellular target. By blocking signaling through the PERK branch of the UPR, ISRIB prevents cells from re-establishing ER homeostasis. Unmitigated ER stress synergizes with ISRIB to induce apoptosis. ISRIB shows good pharmacokinetic properties, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and exhibits no overt toxicity in mice, making it suitable for in vivo studies. As such, ISRIB emerges as a powerful tool to explore the roles of the UPR and the ISR in disease models and physiological processes. In particular, we utilized ISRIB to show that overriding the consequences of eIF2α phosphorylation enhances memory consolidation in rodents, suggesting an important role of eIF2α phosphorylation in modulating higher-order brain function."

Precedence for this possibility derives from genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the molecular mechanism of regulation by eIF2α phosphorylation was first discovered. As in mammalian cells, amino acid starvation in yeast leads to GCN2 activation and eIF2α phosphorylation, resulting in overall translational down-regulation and translational induction of a transcriptional activator, GCN4, mediated by uORFs in the 5′UTR of its mRNA (Hinnebusch, 2005). eIF2B is a conserved protein complex comprised of five different subunits, two of which form the catalytic core, and the remaining three have regulatory roles. Mutations in different eIF2B subunits can elicit a phospho-eIF2α resistant phenotype (Vazquez de Aldana and Hinnebusch, 1994; Pavitt et al., 1997, 1998). These mutations have been proposed to act either by weakening the interaction of phospho-eIF2α with eIF2B, reducing its ability to outcompete non-phosphorylated eIF2 for binding, or by allowing binding of phospho-eIF2α to the mutant eIF2B in a manner that is conducive to nucleotide exchange.

Precedence for this possibility derives from studies in macrophages, where engagement of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 results in activation of the catalytic activity of eIF2B (Woo et al., 2012). This activation results from engagement of the TLR-signaling pathway that induces a phosphatase removing a constitutively present inhibitory phosphate from the eIF2B ε-subunit (S539). Pathogens utilize this mechanism to circumvent translational attenuation and CHOP production under prolonged stress-inducing conditions (Woo et al., 2009). ISRIB did not reduce phosphorylation of S539 in the eIF2B ε-subunit (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), indicating that it does not utilize this particular regulatory phosphorylation to increase GEF activity. However, ISRIB may modulate other post-translational modifications that impinge on the activity of eIF2B."

      "content": "As a signaling network with interconnected signaling branches, the UPR exhibits both cytoprotective and pro-apoptotic functions. When faced with ER stress, PERK-mediated translational attenuation contributes to adaptation by reducing the load of newly synthesized proteins that are translocated into the ER (Harding et al., 2000). In addition, induction of the transcription regulator ATF4 upregulates many genes that increase the protein folding capacity in the ER. Both of these activities serve to reestablish homeostasis, balancing the protein folding load and protein folding capacity in the ER lumen. This reasoning is supported by the increased sensitivity to ER stress exhibited by MEFs that lack PERK or ATF4, as well as MEFs that carry a non-phosphorylatable knock-in allele of eIF2α(S51A) (Harding et al., 2000; Harding et al., 2003; Lu et al., 2004). In agreement, we show that ISRIB decreases the viability of cells that are subjected to ER-stress. In these cells, ISRIB sustains IRE1 and ATF6 activation, indicating that ER stress remains unmitigated in the absence of PERK signaling. As some cancer cells sustain an activated UPR to aid in their survival, ISRIB could provide a new therapeutic approach to cancer chemotherapy. In agreement, a PERK-specific inhibitor demonstrates antitumor activity in a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model (Axten et al., 2012). The deleterious synergistic effect between ER-stress and ISRIB may be generally advantageous to kill cancer cells, especially those derived from secretory lineages that have increased secretory load and increased basal levels of ER stress (including myelomas, and pancreatic and breast cancers)."

In particular, the threshold for induction of L-LTP is reduced and memory consolidation is enhanced in mice lacking GCN2 or PKR and in mice heterozygous for non-phosphorylatable eIF2α(S51A), which have reduced levels of eIF2α phosphorylation (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2005; Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011). As we show here, ISRIB pharmacologically phenocopies these genetic manipulations in behavioral tasks by rendering cells insensitive to eIF2α phosphorylation. In agreement, treatment of mice with a PKR inhibitor was reported to enhance memory consolidation, and, conversely, treatment with salubrinal, an inhibitor that prolongs eIF2α phosphorylation, to block L-LTP and memory consolidation (Costa-Mattioli et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011)."

      "content": "eIF2α phosphorylation results in a dual effect on gene expression: a global translational diminution and translational upregulation of select mRNA, including ATF4 mRNA. Both may be important to explain the observed effects on L-LTP and memory. It has long been appreciated that new protein synthesis is required for memory consolidation and that ATF4 represses CREB-mediated transcription of ‘memory genes’ (Klann and Dever, 2004; Sutton and Schuman, 2006). Indeed, this latter function of ATF4 in memory consolidation is evolutionarily conserved from Aplysia to rodents (Yin et al., 1994; Bartsch et al., 1995; Chen et al., 2003). Because a small physiological increase in the level of eIF2α phosphorylation that does not significantly alter overall translation is sufficient to induce ATF4, production of this transcription factor can be finely tuned in neuronal cells by perhaps selective activation of different eIF2α kinases. The observed effects of ISRIB may therefore result from overcoming effects caused by a relatively small level of regulatory phosphorylation that is distinct from the high level resulting from ER stress-inducing agents. In light of this reasoning, a therapeutic window may exist in which ISRIB’s effects as memory enhancer can be exploited without encountering long-term toxic consequences."

Indeed, eIF2α phosphorylation also plays a role in dynamic restructuring of memory, as indicated by studies showing that ablation of PERK in the brain impairs behavioral flexibility (Trinh et al., 2012). Our findings raise the possibility that ISRIB or compounds with related activities could serve as invaluable tools in deciphering these higher order brain functions and perhaps be beneficial as a therapeutic agent effecting memory improvement in diseases associated with memory impairment."

The resulting construct, pCAX-ATF4-FLuc, was then digested with BamHI, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and then digested with XhoI. The resulting fragment was then subcloned into the retroviral expression vector pLPCX (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) after digesting it with HindIII, blunting with T4 DNA polymerase and then digesting with XhoI to generate pLPCX-ATF4-FLuc (DAA-312). DAA-312 was used to produce recombinant retroviruses using standard methods and the resulting viral supernatant was used to transduce HEK293T cells, which were then subsequently selected with puromycin to generate a stable cell line employed in the primary screen."

      "content": "The ATF4-dEGFP reporter was generated using a PCR fusion-based approach. A PCR product containing the ATF4 full-length 5′ leader sequence (from +1 position a the transcription start site) fused to the eGFP coding sequence 1 nucleotide downstream of the terminator codon of the second uORF, and flanked by BamHI and EcoRI, was cloned into the cognate sites of pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to generate pCMV-ATF4-eGFP. To destabilize the eGFP fusion protein and increase the dynamic range of the reporter, residues 422–461 of mouse ornithine decarboxylase (mODC1), corresponding to its PEST sequence (Li et al., 1998), were fused to the C-terminus of the ATF-eGFP fusion protein. To such end, the corresponding mODC1 coding sequence was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BstXI and EcoRI sites of pCMV-ATF4-eGFP. The resulting construct was designated pCMV-ATF4-d2EGFP. To further destabilize the ATF4-d1EGFP fusion protein, alanine substitutions E428A, E430A, E431A (Li et al., 1998) were introduced in the ODC1 PEST sequence to generate pCMV-ATF4-d1EGFP. The ATF4-d1EGFP coding sequence was then excised from the expression vector using BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the BglII-EcoRI sites of the retroviral expression vector pLPCX (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to generate pLPCX-ATF4-d2EGFP. Lastly, a fusion PCR product containing the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (EMCV-IRES) upstream of the monomeric cherry (mCherry) coding sequence and flanked by EcoRI and NotI recognition sites was subcloned into the cognate sites of pLPCX-ATF4-d1EGFP, thereby generating pLPCX-ATF4-d1EGFP-IRES-mCherry (DAA-361). DAA-361 was used to produce recombinant retroviruses using standard methods and the resulting viral supernatant was used to transduce U2OS cells, which were then subsequently selected with puromycin to generate a stable cell line employed in the secondary screen."

The primary screen had a Z′ = 0.5 and its hit rate was 0.6% (compounds were considered a hit if their luciferase readouts were beyond three standard deviations of the mean luminescence intensity of thapsigargin treated cells, which corresponded to 54% inhibition). Of these, only 187 compounds did not hit a luciferase-based XBP1 splicing reporter used as proxy to measure activation of the IRE1 branch of the UPR.

The infusion was performed with a microinjector (28 gauge) connected to a Hamilton syringe with plastic tubing at a rate of 0.25 μl/min. To allow for the solution containing ISRIB to diffuse from the tip of the cannula into the tissue, the microinjector stayed in the cannula for one additional minute. Training protocol for auditory fear conditioning consisted of a 2-min period of context A exploration, followed by one pairing of a tone (5000 Hz, 75 dB, 30 s) with a co-terminating foot shock (0.75 mA, 1 s). Rats were returned to their home cage 1 min after the shock. Test for auditory fear memory consisted of a 2 min acclimatizing period to the context B (pre-CS), followed by tone presentation (CS) (2800 Hz, 85 dB, 30 s). Freezing time was measured and percent of freezing was calculated. At the end of the experiment, cannula placement was checked by examining 50 μm brain sections stained with formal-thionin under a light microscope."
