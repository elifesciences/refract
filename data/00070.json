Levels of H2BE are heterogeneous among olfactory neurons, but stereotyped according to the identity of the co-expressed olfactory receptor (OR). Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that changes in H2be expression affect olfactory function and OR representation in the adult olfactory epithelium. We show that H2BE expression is reduced by sensory activity and that it promotes neuronal cell death, such that inactive olfactory neurons display higher levels of the variant and shorter life spans. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of H2BE differ from those of the canonical H2B, consistent with a role for H2BE in altering transcription. We propose a physiological function for H2be in modulating olfactory neuron population dynamics to adapt the OR repertoire to the environment."

This phenomenon underlies the ability of our brains to develop properly and to learn, and also enables various sensory systems—including the visual, auditory and olfactory systems—to perform optimally in diverse environments."

      "content": "In most mammals, a high-functioning olfactory system is essential for carrying out tasks that are crucial for survival, such as finding food, avoiding predators and mating. In general, sensory systems have to decipher only a limited collection of stimuli, but the olfactory system must be able to process information from thousands of distinct odors that are found in a given environment and which may vary dramatically from one environment to the next. Each odor-sensing neuron in the nose of a mammal contains just one kind of odorant receptor protein, although mammalian genomes typically encode 1000 or so different kinds of receptor proteins. This suggests that it might be possible to ‘tune’ the olfactory system to a particular environment by changing the relative numbers of the different types of neurons. Indeed, it is known that the relative abundance of each type of odor-sensing neuron changes with age and experience, and that these changes might be caused by variations in the lifespans of the neurons."

      "content": "Although our understanding of how these experience-dependent changes are orchestrated at the molecular level is far from complete, it is clear that adjustments in the levels of specific gene products is necessary. But how do experiences alter the levels of gene products to give rise to lasting changes in the brain? One hypothesis is that changes to a structure called chromatin are key to this process: chromatin is an assembly of DNA molecules, which are quite long, and organizing proteins, mostly proteins known as histones, that together form a compact structure that can fit inside the nucleus of a cell."

      "content": "Santoro and Dulac have now discovered a previously uncharacterized protein called H2BE that is found only in the odor-sensing neurons of mice. H2BE is a variant of a protein called H2B, which is a well-known histone. They found that in odor-sensing neurons, H2BE replaces H2B to an extent that depends on the amount of activity experienced by the neuron: H2BE is nearly undetectable in highly active neurons, but almost completely replaces H2B in neurons that are inactive. Moreover, genetic manipulation showed that the deletion of H2BE significantly extended the lifespan of neurons, whereas elevated levels of H2BE shortened their lifespan. These findings reveal an extraordinary process that involves inactive odor-sensing neurons being depleted relative to active ones over time."

      "content": "How does H2BE, which differs from H2B by just five amino acids, cause such dramatic changes in neuronal composition? One hint comes from evidence that these amino acids disrupt interactions between chromatin and ‘effector’ proteins, which modulate gene activity. Consistent with this, Santoro and Dulac have found that the replacement of H2B by H2BE strongly alters gene activity, although the precise mechanism by which these alterations regulate neuronal lifespans remains to be determined. Understanding this process in detail, and exploring if similar phenomena are involved in experience-dependent changes elsewhere in the nervous system, are fascinating areas of future research."

These activity-dependent changes occur during critical windows of neuronal development as well as in the adult brain, enabling the animal to best perform in a given environment. Pioneering experiments in the visual system showed that patterns of light stimuli reaching each of the two eyes are essential for the activity-dependent refinement of ocular dominance columns in the visual cortex during perinatal development (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977). Similarly, experience-dependent plasticity has been shown to participate in the functional maturation of other sensory systems, including the auditory, somatosensory, and olfactory systems (Hensch, 2004). In addition to their important role in shaping sensory circuits during development, environmental stimuli can also significantly affect adult brain structures, leading to adaptive as well as maladaptive changes in sensory responses (Buonomano and Merzenich, 1998; Ramachandran and Hirstein, 1998; Moseley and Flor, 2012)."

The mouse main olfactory epithelium (MOE) offers a unique opportunity to investigate the range and mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity within a peripheral sensory tissue, where the primary sensory detection occurs. The MOE detects large arrays of chemical cues through the expression of a large family of olfactory receptor (OR) genes (Buck and Axel, 1991). Individual olfactory neurons express a single OR allele chosen through a largely stochastic process (Chess et al., 1994). The olfactory epithelium of mammals displays continuous neurogenesis throughout adulthood, such that a slow dividing olfactory neural stem cell population continuously replaces mature olfactory neurons that have variable, though finite, life spans (Kondo et al., 2010)."

Our data suggest that H2be participates in a pathway that shapes the cellular and molecular composition of the olfactory epithelium based on signals from the external environment, and thus uncover a novel chromatin-based mechanism for activity-dependent neuronal plasticity."

Microarray and in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses revealed high expression of H2be in the MOE and apical VNO neuroepithelium (Figure 1A,B), but no expression in the olfactory bulb (OB) or brain. The Genepaint and Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation (GNF) GeneAtlas (Su et al., 2004) databases, which contain transcriptional information for embryo sections (Figure 1C) and 61 mouse tissues (Figure 1D), respectively, confirmed the remarkable specificity of H2be expression in the MOE and VNO."

This contrasts with typical histone transcripts that lack poly-A tails but contain short 3′-stem loop UTRs, which facilitate coordination of histone expression with the cell cycle. These features, together with the observed presence of its mRNA in post-mitotic neurons, suggest that H2be encodes a replication-independent replacement histone. H2BE displays only five amino-acid differences with the canonical mouse H2B protein (Figure 1E). Potential human (Collart et al., 1992), rat, and bovine orthologs to H2be exist, although their expression is uncharacterized."

(A) Flag-H2be transgenic construct, generated through modification of a BAC containing the H2be genomic region by insertion of a FLAG-encoding sequence immediately upstream of the H2be CDS. (B,C) Representative images of FLAG-H2BE in MOE (B) and VNO (C) from 10-week old Flag-H2be transgenic mice. (D) Quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of Flag-H2be transgene mRNA levels in whole MOE tissue from three-week old Flag-H2be(+/−) transgenic mice. Signals were normalized to a value of three, corresponding to a primer pair recognizing all three H2be mRNAs (two endogenous and one transgenic). A primer pair specific for the Flag-tagged transgenic allele produces a normalized signal of approximately 1, indicating similar per-allele expression levels for the transgenic and endogenous H2be alleles. Negative control samples (−RT) were prepared by omitting reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis. (E) Colocalization analysis of FLAG-H2BE protein and H2be mRNA in the MOE of a 3-week old Flag-H2be(+/−) transgenic mouse. Observation of occasional basally-located neurons that are H2be-mRNA-positive and FLAG-H2BE-negative is likely due to an expected lag in protein production and accumulation following H2be transcription onset during neuronal development. (F) Colocalization analysis of Olfr867 or Olfr1463 (arrowheads) and FLAG-H2BE, showing representative ORs associated with high or low levels of H2BE, respectively. Mouse age: 10 weeks. (G) Quantification of average H2BE levels in neurons expressing specific ORs (n = from 4 to 36 neurons per OR examined; mean, 18).

      "content": "Due to the abundance of available molecular and genetic tools, we focused our study on the prospective role of H2be in the MOE. Initial expression analyses revealed that H2be mRNA and protein levels are not uniform among olfactory neurons. Rather, neurons with variable expression levels appear intermingled, and apically-located neurons generally display the highest levels of expression (Figures 1A and 2B). The heterogeneous expression of H2be among MOE neurons could potentially reflect differences in the identity of the co-expressed OR, in neuronal maturity, or in some unknown biological feature. To examine the relationship between H2be and OR expression, we used fluorescent ISH (FISH) to identify mature neurons expressing each of 42 specific OR genes. We then used quantitative fluorescence microscopy (Waters, 2009) (see ‘Materials and methods’) to assess the level of FLAG-H2BE within nuclei of the identified neurons relative to their surrounding neuronal field, imaged in tissue sections spanning the length of the MOE, and across multiple animals (n ≥ 2 per OR). Strikingly, each OR tested appears consistently and reproducibly associated with a stereotyped level of H2BE in mature neurons (Figure 2F,G). Indeed, for 73% of the tested ORs, neurons expressing the same OR display significantly less variation with each other in their H2BE level than is observed within the entire MOE neuronal population (p<0.05 after false-discovery rate [FDR] correction; 1-tailed F-test). These results indicate that H2BE expression in a given neuron is tightly correlated with the identity of the co-expressed OR, and not with a specific stage of neuronal development or maturity."

We refer to this line as H2be-KO. Analysis of GAP43-mCherry fluorescence in the MOE of H2be-KO mice revealed a variable intensity of the fluorescent reporter similar to that observed for the endogenous gene (Figure 3B). Analysis of GAP43-mCherry in the olfactory bulb revealed fluorescence limited to sensory axon termini in the glomerular layer. Fluorescence intensities appeared to vary widely among glomeruli, which are each innervated by neurons expressing a given OR, a result consistent with our observations of variable but stereotyped H2BE levels in neurons expressing specific ORs (Figure 3C)."

Training of H2be-KO mice and littermate controls to discriminate between odors for a water reward revealed that H2be-KO mice learn the task more slowly and perform less efficiently than the controls, suggesting a defect in olfactory function (Figure 3D). To investigate a potential defect in olfactory signal transduction, we performed electro-olfactograms on MOEs from H2be-KO and heterozygous littermates (Figure 3E) but found no obvious anomalies, indicating that the observed phenotype is not due to gross defects in odor-evoked signaling."

Microarray analysis of whole MOE tissue in 6-month old H2be-KO and WT mice revealed that approximately 6% of transcripts are differentially expressed (p<0.05; Supplementary file 1A; Figure 4—source data 1), a value that may underestimate the effects of H2be loss in the fraction of MOE cells that express H2be. Qualitatively, the effects of H2be loss appear to depend on the normal expression level of a given gene: highly transcribed genes tend to be up-regulated, while moderately transcribed genes appear up- or down-regulated in H2be-KO mice (not shown). Although the differentially-expressed genes do not pass the p<0.05 threshold after FDR adjustment for the 28,064 probe sets tested, likely due to their moderate fold changes, they do show statistically significant enrichment in several gene ontology categories (FDR-adjusted p<0.05; Figure 4A). The categories enriched most strongly among up-regulated genes include ‘olfactory detection’ (consisting of OR genes) and ‘RNA processing’, and among down-regulated genes include ‘developmental process’ and ‘positive regulation of transcription’."

Interestingly, a comparison of gene expression at 6 months with an earlier age of 5 weeks revealed that OR expression differences between WT and H2be-KO mice increase dramatically with age (Figure 4C), and display a significant bias towards up-regulation in the KO (p<10−30, 1-tailed paired t-test). To determine if defects in OR mRNA levels originate from differences in the frequency of OR expression in the MOE, in the cellular level of OR transcripts in individual neurons, or in both, we analyzed the expression of specific ORs by RNA FISH. For each of four ORs quantified, expression differences in H2be-KO and WT mice strongly correlate with differences in OR frequencies (Figure 4D,E) and not cellular levels (not shown). Remarkably, expression differences observed for various ORs in H2be-KO and WT mice were also found to correlate with the level of H2BE with which they are normally co-expressed: ORs with increased expression in H2be-KO mice are associated with high levels of H2BE, while ORs with decreased or unchanged expression appear associated with low H2BE levels (Figure 4F)."

      "content": "Changes in the representation of neurons expressing specific ORs upon loss of H2be led us to predict that ectopic over-expression of H2be might also affect OR frequencies. We generated an Omp:Flag-H2be transgenic mouse line (referred to as H2be-GF) in which Flag-H2be is expressed under the control of the promoter for olfactory marker protein (Omp; Figure 5A), a gene highly expressed in mature olfactory neurons (Danciger et al., 1989). An H2be-GF founder line was identified by quantitative PCR as expressing the transgene at a approximately 10-fold higher level than the endogenous H2be gene (not shown). This line displayed a high level of FLAG-H2BE in all mature olfactory neurons except for a subset in zone 2 (Figure 5B). We reasoned that this serendipitous mosaic expression provided an internal control for the effects of H2be over-expression. Comparison of overall gene expression in MOE tissue from H2be-GF and WT mice revealed widespread differences (Supplementary file 1B; Figure 5—source data 1). Strikingly, both up- and down-regulated genes are dominated by ORs, exhibiting FDR-adjusted p-values of 7 × 10−29 and 3 × 10−18, respectively, for enrichment in the ‘olfactory detection’ category (Figure 5C). Using an FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, we found that approximately 7% of ORs display significant expression differences in H2be-GF mice (Figure 5D). As observed for H2be-KO mice, OR expression changes in H2be-GF mice are strongly correlated with H2BE expression (Figure 5E,F,H) and reflect changes in OR expression frequency, such that ORs that are consistently co-expressed with the transgene are reduced in frequency, while ORs that escape co-expression with the transgene within zone 2 are increased (Figure 5F–I)."

To investigate the temporal onset of H2BE expression relative to OR gene choice, we took advantage of the basal to apical gradient of neuronal development in the MOE. Analysis of the onset of H2BE relative to ORs normally associated with high levels of H2BE revealed that H2BE expression is initiated well after OR expression (Figure 6A). We next compared the onset of H2be expression to that of Neurod1, Gap43, and Omp, which are expressed prior to, concurrently with, and subsequent to OR gene choice, respectively (Cau et al., 2002; Iwema and Schwob, 2003; Kolterud et al., 2004). We found that the onset of H2be expression follows the window of Neurod1 expression, as observed at both the protein and RNA levels in MOE tissue from Flag-H2be and WT mice, respectively (Figure 6B,C). Moreover, H2BE expression begins after GAP43 (Figure 6D) and before OMP (Figure 6E), but overlaps extensively with both. Together, these results confirm that H2BE is present prior to full neuronal maturity, but subsequent to OR choice. Thus H2BE is unlikely to participate in the process of OR choice."

We found no defects in OR co-expression frequencies (Figure 7A) or in the position or number of glomeruli (Figure 7B) in H2be-KO mice, which are phenotypes expected to be associated with the aberrant expression of multiple OR genes or the abnormal switching between distinct ORs (Shykind et al., 2004), suggesting that H2BE is not likely involved in the maintenance of OR gene choice. Finally, as described previously, gene expression analyses indicate that OR expression defects in H2be-KO mice are markedly more severe at 6 months of age than at 5 weeks (Figure 4C). Since disruption in OR gene choice would be expected to cause defects in OR expression that are independent of age, the delayed appearance of OR expression defects in H2be-KO mice is inconsistent with a role for H2BE in this process."

      "content": "We next investigated the alternative hypothesis that altered OR frequencies in H2be-KO and H2be-GF mice may result from changes in neuronal longevity. Analysis of active-CASP3-labeled mature olfactory neurons in H2be-KO and littermate controls revealed a 45% lower frequency of apoptosis in the mutant epithelium (Figure 7C). Moreover, analysis of the life span of 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled neurons revealed a significantly higher survival rate in H2be-KO mice compared to controls (Figure 7D). These results indicate that the loss of H2be increases the life span of mature neurons. Accordingly, similar analyses in H2be-GF mice revealed a twofold higher rate of apoptosis among mature neurons (Figure 7E) and a significantly reduced survival rate compared to Flag-H2be mice (Figure 7F). Remarkably, the initial BrdU labeling frequency of H2be-GF neurons is approximately 2.9-fold higher than that observed in control neurons, reflecting an elevated rate of neurogenesis, presumably a consequence of the increased rate of apoptosis (Figure 7G). To ensure that the observed increase in apoptosis in transgenic epithelia is not due to a non-specific toxic effect of the overexpressed histone, we expressed H2be or Flag-H2be at high levels in cultured fibroblast (NIH-3T3) or embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells. Transgene-expressing cells showed no increase in cell death compared to control cells overexpressing the canonical H2b or containing no transgene (not shown), suggesting that H2BE's action in affecting cellular longevity requires an olfactory-specific cellular context. Taken together, these data indicate that the expression of H2be in mature olfactory neurons directly affects neuronal longevity, such that neurons with low expression of H2BE tend to have longer life spans, while neurons with elevated H2BE tend to be relatively short-lived."

To investigate a possible link with neuronal activity, we performed unilateral naris occlusion (UNO) by surgically blocking airflow into one nostril of Flag-H2be mice for 10 days. Upon analysis of H2BE in the MOE of these mice, we observed dramatically higher H2BE expression on the closed side of the epithelium relative to the open side. This increase can be observed at the cellular level in neurons expressing a specific OR (Figure 8A,B), and in the GAP43-mCherry fluorescence within the ipsilateral and contralateral olfactory bulbs of H2be-KO(+/−) mice (Figure 8C). Together, these results indicate that olfactory deprivation causes an up-regulation of H2BE."

After 3 weeks of exposure to the odor mixture or mineral oil, the four stimulated neuronal subtypes showed significantly reduced levels of H2BE compared to the same subtypes in control mice (Figure 8D–F; Figure 8—figure supplement 1). In contrast, neurons expressing two randomly picked orphan ORs, Olfr167 and Olfr653, showed no statistically significant differences between odor-exposed and control mice.

These analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between the two markers, further supporting the view that H2be gene expression is inversely related to neuronal activity (Figure 8G,H)."

      "content": "To investigate the possibility that H2BE expression is regulated by cAMP or Ca2+, two important signaling components and modulators of gene expression in the MOE (Mori and Sakano, 2011), we looked for evidence of changes in H2BE levels in Adcy3-null and Cnga2-null mice, respectively. We found that olfactory neurons that contain undetectable levels of H2BE in WT mice frequently show extremely high levels in their Adcy3(−/−) counterparts (Figure 9A). However, using GAP43-mCherry as a reporter of H2be expression in Cnga2(+/−) mosaic females, we observed no elevation in GAP43-mCherry fluorescence in Cnga2− glomeruli relative to Cnga2+ glomeruli (Figure 9B). These results suggest that the activity-dependent down-regulation of H2BE is cAMP- but not Ca2+-mediated. The precise mechanism of H2BE regulation by cAMP is unclear. One possibility is that H2be expression is suppressed by a factor such as ICER, a cAMP-dependent repressor form of the cyclic-AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) family member CREM (Lyons and West, 2011). Interestingly, we identified two CRE half-sites within the H2be coding region, although their function, if any, is unknown."

In Adcy3(+/+) mice, Olfr1508+ neurons contain extremely low H2BE levels (left, arrowheads), while in Adcy3(−/−) mice, Olfr1508+ neurons frequently contain extremely high levels (right, arrowhead), indicating that cAMP participates in the negative regulation of H2BE. Note: age P0 was chosen due to the low postnatal survival rate of Adcy3(−/−) mice. (B) Effects of Cnga2 loss-of-function on H2be expression. Mice in which Cnga2 (an X-chromosomal gene necessary for odor-evoked Ca2+ signaling) was replaced with the Tau-LacZ gene (Zhao and Reed, 2001) were crossed with H2be-KO mice to generate three-week old Cnga2-KO-Tau-LacZ(+/−)/H2be-KO-Gap43-mCherry(+/−) compound heterozygous females. In these mice, one half of new olfactory neurons express TAU-LACZ instead of CNGA2 and project to glomeruli distinct from neurons expressing Cnga2 (Zheng et al., 2000). Analysis of β-GAL+ (TAU-LACZ) and GAP43-mCherry intensities within glomeruli revealed that Cnga2− neurons (β-GAL+; arrowheads) do not have higher levels of GAP43-mCherry than Cnga2+ neurons (β-GAL−), indicating that H2be expression is not negatively regulated by Ca2+ signaling. Scale bars for (A), 40 µm; (B), 100 µm."

Consistent with a recent study (Coppola and Waggener, 2011), we identified widespread differences in gene expression after activity deprivation in WT mice, with ‘olfactory detection’ (ORs) identified as the most highly enriched gene ontology category among both up- and down-regulated genes (Figure 10A; Figure 10—source data 1). Using an FDR-adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05, approximately 11.5% of ORs display significant expression differences after olfactory deprivation in WT mice (Figure 10B). FISH analyses revealed that these differences reflect altered OR expression frequencies within the MOE (Figure 10C,D)."

Remarkably, this analysis revealed that ORs that are down-regulated following UNO are normally co-expressed with high levels of H2BE, while up-regulated ORs are normally co-expressed with low H2BE levels (Figure 10E,F). Thus, if H2BE level is taken as a measure of neuronal inactivity, these data suggest that olfactory deprivation causes normally inactive neurons to decrease in relative abundance, while leading to a relative increase in neurons that are highly active."

According to this model, inactive neurons express high levels of H2BE, which leads to reduced longevity, while active neurons maintain low levels of H2BE and are relatively long-lived. This model predicts that OR expression frequencies should change with age and experience and lead to the gradual enrichment of active olfactory neurons at the expense of inactive neurons in the MOE. Consistent with this prediction and previous reports of age-dependent changes in OR expression (Lee et al., 2009; Rimbault et al., 2009; Rodriguez-Gil et al., 2010), we found that 65% of all ORs are significantly altered in their expression from 5 weeks to 6 months of age in WT mice (FDR-adjusted p<0.05; not shown). Future experiments will determine the physiological significance of the ORs displaying age-dependent altered expression."

Fractionation of unfixed MOE cell nuclei from Flag-H2be and H2be-GF transgenic mice showed that FLAG-H2BE is present at barely detectable levels in soluble nucleoplasm and is instead almost entirely chromatin-bound (Figure 13A). Moreover, mass spectrometric analysis of proteins associated with FLAG-H2BE mononucleosomes from Flag-H2be MOE tissue identified numerous chromatin-associated proteins, including several canonical and variant histones (Figure 13B). Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using anti-FLAG antibodies yielded large quantities of DNA from Flag-H2be MOE tissue (Figure 13C). Together, these results provide strong evidence that FLAG-H2BE is readily integrated into the chromatin of olfactory neurons and support the use of Flag-H2be and H2be-GF mice for investigating the molecular function of H2BE."

High-resolution confocal imaging of neuronal nuclei in the MOE of Flag-H2be mice revealed that H2BE is not confined to nuclear puncta, but rather is widely distributed throughout the nucleus (Figure 13D). Analysis of H2BE localization by genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) in MOE neurons confirmed its wide distribution and revealed a slight enrichment near gene promoters, especially in genes highly expressed in mature olfactory neurons (Figure 13E). Interestingly, these analyses and subsequent qPCR experiments revealed that the protein-coding regions of histone genes are particularly enriched for H2BE, while those of OR and vomeronasal receptor (VR) genes are relatively devoid of the variant (Figure 13F–H). Because the ChIP input was obtained from a heterogeneous mixture of MOE nuclei and approximately 99.9% of OR alleles and all VR alleles are silent in a given olfactory neuron, the latter results may reflect the lower accessibility of silent OR and VR loci for replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, perhaps due to the highly compacted nature of these loci (Magklara et al., 2011). Together, our results support a model in which H2BE replacement of canonical H2B within olfactory chromatin is widespread, but most extensive within transcriptionally active loci."

Both H2B-Lys5 PTMs have been shown to be positively correlated with transcriptional activity, with Lys5-Me and Lys5-Ac enriched within transcribed and promoter regions, respectively (Barski et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2008). H2B-Lys120 ubiquitination, which has also been linked with transcription, appears to play a complex regulatory role (Chandrasekharan et al., 2010)."

      "content": "Analysis of H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me levels in Flag-H2be MOEs revealed a striking inverse correlation between the two staining patterns, such that neurons expressing a high level of H2BE display conspicuously low H2B-Lys5-Me immunoreactivity, and vice versa (Figure 14A,B). Using an ELISA assay, we ruled out the possibility that the polyclonal antibody against H2B-Lys5-Me is incompatible with the H2BE sequence (Figure 14C). To determine if there is a causal link between the seemingly mutually exclusive expression of H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me, we examined the prevalence of H2B-Lys5-Me in H2be-KO and H2be-GF mice. Remarkably, loss of H2be leads to widespread H2B-Lys5-Me immunoreactivity in H2be-KO MOEs (Figure 14D), while over-expression of H2BE further reduces H2B-Lys5-Me staining in H2BE-positive nuclei (Figure 14E). Western analysis of MOE lysates from Flag-H2be mice provided a biochemical confirmation that the Lys5-Me modification is absent from the tagged H2BE (Figure 14F). Together, our results suggest that, unlike canonical H2B, H2BE does not undergo detectable mono-methylation at Lys5 and that, consequently, replacement of H2B by H2BE causes a direct reduction of the Lys5-Me modification in H2BE expressing cells. Interestingly, we observe an increase in the number of H2BE expressing neurons, and in H2BE level in individual cells in the MOEs of older animals (Figure 14G–I). This is supported by western analysis, which revealed that the overall level of H2BE in the MOE doubles from 7 weeks to 45 weeks (approximately 10 months) of age (Figure 14J). In addition, we observe that the mutual exclusion between H2BE and H2B-Lys5-Me dramatically increases with age (Figure 14G–I), indicating the gradual replacement of canonical H2B by H2BE, which proceeds to near-completion in a fraction of neurons by 36 weeks (approximately 8.5 months) of age. Further, it suggests that the accumulation of H2BE through replacement of canonical H2B proceeds at a faster pace than it's loss through neuronal turnover."

      "content": "The mammalian olfactory epithelium has the unusual property of persistent neuronal self-renewal throughout adult life. Thus, the repertoire of expressed ORs in the MOE is determined by the combined probabilities associated with the choice of a specific OR by olfactory neuron precursors and the subsequent longevity of those neurons. OR gene choice has been shown to obey a largely stochastic process influenced by the genomic context of local enhancers (Mori and Sakano, 2011). In contrast, olfactory life span appears variable and may be influenced by environmental factors such as pathogens and odorant stimulation (Watt et al., 2004; Kondo et al., 2010). Our data uncover a chromatin-based pathway in which the absence of odor-evoked activity of specific MOE neuronal populations leads to increased H2BE expression, and in turn changes in transcription and reduced neuronal life span. In addition to a pro-apoptotic role of high levels of H2BE, we cannot exclude other roles for this olfactory-specific histone variant at low or moderate levels. Indeed our data indicate that neurons that are normally highly active and therefore express low levels of H2BE increase in abundance following olfactory deprivation, an effect that is diminished in H2be-KO mice. This result may be due to a compensatory increase of the low-H2BE expressing cells following olfactory deprivation, but could also indicate that a modest level of H2BE is optimal for neuronal longevity. In addition, our findings that changes in transcription and OR frequency following unilateral naris occlusion are significantly reduced but not eliminated in H2be-KO mice indicate that H2BE plays a key role in modulating activity dependent changes, but is likely part of a larger pathway."

Interestingly, a previous study showing enhanced longevity of odor-stimulated adenovirus-infected olfactory neurons implicated CREB as the mediator of this effect (Watt et al., 2004). The absence of full CRE sites in the H2be gene does not permit the establishment of a direct functional link between the activity of a CREB family member such as ICER and H2BE levels at this point, but other indirect signaling pathways may exist. An alternative scenario would postulate the existence of a cAMP-regulated chaperone that exchanges canonical H2B and H2BE."

Such studies suggest the possibility that ligand-independent, OR-derived basal signaling may also contribute to the overall activity level in mature olfactory neurons, especially under laboratory housing conditions where the odor repertoire is minimal. This scenario would help explain the observation that loss of Adcy3, which eliminates both basal and odor-stimulated activity, appears to affect H2be levels more dramatically than olfactory deprivation through UNO, which is expected to only eliminate odor-evoked activity. Thus, along with odor-evoked activity, OR-derived basal activity may be a significant contributor to the control of H2BE levels and, in turn, of olfactory neuronal longevity."

Like SEMA3A, H2BE levels are reduced via cAMP-dependent/ Ca2+-independent signaling, but unlike the other known activity dependent molecules, which are generally expressed in either immature or mature neurons, H2BE is expressed in both. The unusual regulation of H2BE expression likely reflects the variant's unique function in olfactory neurons."

      "content": "How do the five amino acid differences between H2BE and H2B convey such distinct functional attributes? Studies of H3.3, a histone variant that differs with canonical H3 by merely four amino acids and that plays a critical role in embryonic development and gene expression in adulthood, illustrate how small sequence variations in histones can generate distinct functions (Elsaesser et al., 2010). Our analyses of relative PTM levels for H2BE and canonical H2B at a handful of known PTM sites suggest that incorporation of the variant could affect cellular transcription at least in part via differential post-translational modifiability. It must be acknowledged, however, that as is true for most histone PTMs, evidence that the PTMs affected by H2BE replacement play a role in transcription is merely correlative and therefore insufficient to support a strong functional prediction. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that H2BE shortens neuronal life span via changes in cellular transcription and metabolism, likely over the time course of several days or weeks, although the precise mechanism for this process remains to be determined. Notably, although phosphorylation of H2B Ser14 has been associated with short trigger of apoptosis in mammalian cells (Cheung et al., 2003), we have not found evidence for involvement of H2BE in this pathway (not shown)."

      "content": "The extensive activity-dependent shifts in the OR repertoire that we observe complement previous studies reporting experience-dependent sensitivity enhancements (Hudson, 1999) and changes in the sensory neuron representation within the MOE (Jones et al., 2008). A scenario thus emerges according to which neurons expressing ORs associated with environmentally salient odors are frequently active and may increase in relative abundance over time due to enhanced longevity, while neurons expressing infrequently activated ORs have a shortened life span, mediated in part by H2BE, and become less abundant (Figure 12). Differential longevity among olfactory sensory may provide an effective mechanism by which individuals with similar genomes adapt to diverse olfactory environments, facilitating enhanced sensitivity to odors important for survival. Accordingly, we observed significant impairment of olfactory learning behavior in H2be-KO mice, although it remains to be determined whether these defects are due to aberrant OR expression frequencies resulting from the lack of H2BE expression or, alternatively, to the altered expression of other genes involved in olfactory neuron signaling."

Samples were immediately frozen and pooled into groups of 10 (approximately 1000 cells per group), from which the RNA was extracted using the Arcturus Picopure Kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). LCM RNA samples were amplified in parallel with whole VNO RNA samples using the Arcturus RiboAmp OA RNA Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed using Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions."

For analyses of gene expression defects in H2be-KO MOE tissue, FDR corrections were made based on all represented genes with log2 expression levels above five. For analyses of OR expression defects in H2be-GF mice and expression differences following UNO, FDR corrections were made based on all represented OR genes with log2 expression levels above seven or five, respectively."

In an initial experiment, mice were challenged to discriminate between hexanol and hexanoic acid, and in a second experiment, were challenged with the two stereoisomers of carvone. Prior to the initial experiment, mice were trained to obtain water from two ports unconditionally (day 1), after first poking an odor port (days 2–5), after poking an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 6–13), and after only a single poke of an odor port presenting isoamyl-acetate odor (days 14–20). Odor discrimination training began on day 21. Odors streams, controlled by an olfactometer, were generated from air passed through a filter containing 10% of the concentrated odorant in mineral oil and diluted 1:20 into a stream of clean air."
