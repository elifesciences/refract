      "content": "The X-chromosome gene regulatory process called dosage compensation ensures that males (1X) and females (2X) express equal levels of X-chromosome transcripts. The mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans has been elusive due to improperly annotated transcription start sites (TSSs). Here we define TSSs and the distribution of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) genome-wide in wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective animals to dissect this regulatory mechanism. Our TSS-mapping strategy integrates GRO-seq, which tracks nascent transcription, with a new derivative of this method, called GRO-cap, which recovers nascent RNAs with 5′ caps prior to their removal by co-transcriptional processing. Our analyses reveal that promoter-proximal pausing is rare, unlike in other metazoans, and promoters are unexpectedly far upstream from the 5′ ends of mature mRNAs. We find that C. elegans equalizes X-chromosome expression between the sexes, to a level equivalent to autosomes, by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes using a chromosome-restructuring condensin complex."

In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans—which consists of hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO)—this regulatory complex, called the dosage compensation complex (DCC), binds to both X chromosomes of XX individuals, reducing gene expression from each by 50%. DCC shares many subunits with a protein complex called condensin, which regulates the structure of chromosomes to achieve proper chromosome segregation. However, it is unclear exactly how the DCC controls the expression of X-linked genes."

The failure to dosage compensate is lethal. Dosage compensation strategies differ across species, but invariably a regulatory complex is targeted to the X chromosomes of one sex to modulate transcription along the entire X. The molecular mechanisms by which these complexes regulate gene expression remain elusive. Here we analyzed X-chromosome dosage compensation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to determine the step of transcription controlled by its dosage compensation complex (DCC). The DCC binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to reduce transcription by half (Meyer, 2010; Pferdehirt et al., 2011). Sequence-specific DNA binding sites recruit the DCC to X and facilitate its spreading along X (Ercan et al., 2009; Jans et al., 2009; Pferdehirt et al., 2011). The DCC shares subunits with condensin (Csankovszki et al., 2009; Mets and Meyer, 2009), a protein complex required for the compaction, resolution, and segregation of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes (Wood et al., 2010), suggesting that DCC-dependent changes in chromosome structure facilitate transcription regulation. In principle, the DCC could control any step of transcription: recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to the gene promoter, initiation of transcription, escape of Pol II from the promoter or proximal pause sites, elongation of RNA transcripts, or termination of transcription."

Nascent RNA transcripts from approximately 70% of C. elegans genes undergo a rapid co-transcriptional processing event in which the 5′ end is replaced by a common 22-nucleotide leader RNA (SL1) through a trans-splicing mechanism (Blumenthal, 2012). Because trans-splicing removes information about Pol II initiation from nascent RNAs, TSSs have been difficult to identify from accumulated mRNAs (Morton and Blumenthal, 2011). The paucity of annotated promoters has made transcription regulation a challenge to study in C. elegans. By comparing the quantity, location, and direction of engaged Pol II from wild-type and dosage-compensation-defective embryos relative to TSSs, we determined the step of transcription controlled by the DCC."

In GRO-seq reactions, engaged polymerases are allowed to transcribe (run-on) short distances (100 nucleotides) and incorporate affinity tags into their nascent RNAs under conditions that prohibit new initiation (Core et al., 2008). Tagged transcripts are affinity purified, amplified, sequenced, and aligned to the genome to map engaged Pol II (Figure 1A–E)."

Red arrows demark the WormBase (WB) gene models. Dashed vertical lines show the WB gene starts. The GRO-seq signal is in reads per kilobase per million (RPKM). For protein coding genes, the GRO-seq signal was averaged across 25 bp windows with a 25 bp step. The GRO-cap signal is in reads per million (RPM). TAP+ is the signal from capped mRNAs, and TAP− is the background. For (D) and (E), the GRO-cap signal is the TAP+ signal after subtracting the TAP− signal. (A) TSS for a trans-spliced gene. The TSS maps 981 bp upstream of the WB start, with a continuous intervening GRO-seq signal. (B) TSS for the polycistronc microRNA cluster mir-54-56 maps 158 bp upstream of the primary transcript start. (C) TSS for a non-trans-spliced gene. The TSS from GRO-cap and GRO-seq aligns with the WB start site. (D) Identification of the operon TSS shows the operon includes an additional gene, tag-175. The TSS for the operon maps 781 bp upstream of tag-175. (E) TSSs for genes in operons that also use independent promoters, including the TSS for a snoRNA gene within the intron of a gene. vha-10 mRNA is trans-spliced with an SL2 RNA, indicating processing from a polycistronic RNA and an SL1 RNA, indicating transcription from an independent promoter. (F) Heat maps show that TSSs vastly improve gene models. The GRO-seq signal from embryos was plotted, one gene per row, for each of 4246 genes relative to the WB start (left) or the new TSS (right). The genes were ordered with increasing distance between the TSS and WB start. The light line moving rightward in the right panel does not represent TSSs. It reflects reduced GRO-seq signal immediately downstream of the trans-splice acceptor site that has been commonly annotated as the WB start site. (G) Heat maps showing the GRO-cap signal from embryos that was plotted for each of 4246 genes relative to the WB start (left) or the new TSS (right). The genes were ordered with increasing distance between the TSS and WB start."

(C) The TSS for operon CEOP4336 is 6693 bp upstream of both the WB start and the first trans-splice acceptor site. The combination of continuous Pol II signal in the upstream regions and the lack of 3′ UTRs or polyA signals (Mangone et al., 2010) in the upstream regions implies that transcription within the outron is not from sources other than the designated TSS.

To map TSSs, we determined the highest GRO-cap signal (TAP+ minus TAP−) within 10 bp of the 5′ end of 9148 mature, non-overlapping 21 U-RNAs. Of these RNAs, 5260 (57.5%) had a putative TSS with a GRO-cap Z-score greater than 3 in the 10 bp interval (p<0.01). The TSSs for 4783 (91%) of 21 U-RNAs RNAs with a called TSS were precisely 2 bp upstream of the mature RNA, indicating that 21 U-RNAs receive a 5′ cap and are processed to the mature sequence by removing the two 5′-most base pairs."

Positive distances mean that the TSS is upstream of the annotated WB start or trans-splice acceptor site, while negative distances mean the TSS is downstream. The dotted red line demarks the position where the TSS calls are the same as the WB starts or trans-splicing acceptor site. (A) Plot of distance between TSS and WB start. The prevalence of distances near zero suggests that many WB start positions are correct and likely reflects non-trans-spliced genes. (B) Plot of outron length, the distance between the TSS and site of SL1 attachment to RNAs (Allen et al., 2011). The SL1 trans-splice acceptor sites correspond to the site with the highest number of SL1 reads. Genes with multiple isoforms were eliminated from the analysis if the most 5′ part of the isoform differed. Many outrons are in the 50–500 bp range, consistent with previous estimations, but our data show that outron length is often significantly longer, up to 14 kb."

      "content": "(A)–(C) Comparison of our GRO-seq and GRO-cap profiles to enhancer regions from Chen et al. (2013). (A) Chen et al. (2013) analyzed scRNA sequencing data from mixed-stage embryos to annotate transcription start sites (TSSs). They required that clusters of scRNA signal (labeled as ‘TICs’ and shown in red or blue) be within 200 bp of the WormBase (WB) start to be annotated as a new TSS. They then classified as enhancers (shown in yellow) the scRNA clusters that are not associated with a gene, have specific chromatin modifications not associated with promoters, and overlap with transcription factor binding sites. Shown is a panel from their Figure 6A (© Genome Research, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Our GRO-seq and GRO-cap (TAP+ minus TAP−) data from mixed-stage embryos are shown for the same genomic region upstream of the tol-1 gene as in Figure 6A. Our data and their data are precisely aligned. In this example, spikes of GRO-cap signal correspond with TICs, and several GRO-cap spikes correspond to their newly annotated enhancers. Continuous ChIP-chip signal for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II (8WG16 antibody, modENCODE_3545) and continuous GRO-seq signal occur from the most upstream enhancer to the WB start. The GRO-seq signal increases in intensity as it passes GRO-cap spikes and TICs, suggesting that each transcription initiation event contributes to the cumulative Pol II signal, which stops increasing in intensity once it reaches the WB start. In addition, no 3′ UTRs or polyA sites were found in this tol-1 upstream region from the data sets of Jan et al. (2011) and Mangone et al. (2010), implying no tol-1-independent polyadenylated transcription units in the upstream region. This analysis suggests that for this region some enhancers are likely to be TSSs that give rise to full-length transcripts. (B) The TSS we called for agmo-1 from GRO-cap and GRO-seq data corresponds to the enhancer called by Chen et al. (2013). ChIP-chip data from modENCODE for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II antibody and the lack of 3′ UTRs support the TSS call. The distance between the TSS and both the WB start and the trans-splice acceptor site is 2534 bp. This example further supports the proposal that a proportion of the enhancers are outron TSSs. (C) The TSS we called for pat-2 from GRO-cap and GRO-seq data corresponds to one of the two enhancers called by Chen et al. (2013) upstream of pat-2. ChIP-chip data from modENCODE for hypo-phosphorylated Pol II antibody and the lack of 3′ UTRs support the TSS call. The distance between the TSS and the WB start is 2878 bp, while the distance from the TSS to the trans-splice acceptor site is 2875 bp. This example further supports the proposal that a proportion of the enhancers are outron TSSs. The ChIP-chip signal 3′ of the pat-2 3′ UTR is from the genes on the opposite strand.

This modified GRO-seq procedure, called GRO-cap (Figure 2), enabled us to map TSSs with nucleotide resolution by tracking nascent RNAs prior to trans-splicing. Use of nascent RNAs without size selection also reduces the background from RNAs that are capped post-transcriptionally and increases the probability of identifying TSSs from promoters with low Pol II occupancy."

      "content": "GRO-cap is a modified form of GRO-seq that utilizes the tagging and extensive purification of nascent RNAs from GRO-seq (Core et al., 2008) and then employs redundant enzymatic steps to enrich for RNAs with 5′ caps. Of particular importance to this study, GRO-cap permits analysis of RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing, which replaces true transcription start sites (TSSs) with trans-spliced leader RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans. GRO-seq run-ons have been tuned to extend the length of nascent RNAs by only 100 nucleotides on average, thus minimizing any possibility that independent transcription units might been artifactually linked. In GRO-cap, nuclei are isolated and RNA polymerases are allowed to transcribe briefly in a run-on reaction in the presence of Br-UTP, as in GRO-seq. RNA is isolated but the base-hydrolysis step of GRO-seq is omitted to increase the probability of capturing nascent RNA molecules with a 5′ 7-methyl-GTP cap. BrU-RNAs made during the run-on reaction are enriched by selection with anti-BrdU beads to ensure the identification of true TSSs from capped nascent RNAs rather than 5′ ends from RNAs that received post-transcriptional capping (Fejes-Toth et al., 2009). A 3′ RNA adapter (red) is ligated to the RNAs, followed by another round of bead enrichment. Selection against 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs that do not represent capped RNAs (and any carry-through 5′ RNA adapters) is achieved by sequential enzymatic treatment with Terminator exonuclease to degrade 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs and then alkaline phosphatase to remove 5′ phosphates from 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs resistant to the exonuclease. Half of the nuclear run-on (NRO) RNA pool is treated with tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP+) to remove the 5′ cap from the RNA, thereby exposing a 5′ mono-phosphate. The other half is left untreated (TAP−) to provide a control population of residual 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs that never had 5′ caps. The 5′ mono-phosphate RNAs are ligated to 5′ RNA adapters (blue). The TAP+ and TAP− samples are prepared for Illumina sequencing as in GRO-seq by reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and then amplification of DNA from 5′ and 3′ adapter regions. We note that transcripts <500 bp are captured most efficiently on Illumina sequencing platforms. The enriched TSS regions are identified by mapping the 5′ ends of the sequence reads back to the genome and comparing the TAP+ and TAP− sites to eliminate false TSSs. Comparing the GRO-cap candidate TSSs to the 5′ ends of transcription units defined by GRO-seq permits reliable assignment of TSSs to transcription units."

Identification of the TSS for one operon showed it to include a 5′ gene not previously ascribed to it (Figure 1D). TSSs for several operons showed the TSS to be far downstream (>2 kb) of the WB start, a result we also found for genes not included in operons (Figure 1—figure supplement 10A,B). Within operons some genes have independent promoters to transcribe their pre-mRNAs (Allen et al., 2011), and their TSSs were determined, including snoRNA genes within introns of internal genes (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 10A,C).

      "content": "Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the GRO-seq signal between newly called TSSs and previously identified TSAs reflects legitimate outrons rather than independent overlapping upstream transcripts. First, 3′ UTRs or polyA signals are rare in outrons of >1 kb in length, indicating the engaged Pol II is not from independent polyadenylated transcripts. From 565 such outrons, only 1.4% had an identified 3′ UTR in the Jan et al. (2011) study, and 0.7% had a 3′ UTR in the Mangone et al. (2010) study. Furthermore, only 3.5% had a polyA site (Mangone et al., 2010). Second, regions corresponding to long outrons have a continuous ChIP-chip signal from antibodies enriched for either the ser2 phosphorylated form of Pol II or the hypo-phosphorylated form of Pol II (Figure 1—figure supplement 8A–C). These results and the restricted run-on length of ∼100 nucleotides (Core et al., 2008) indicate that the GRO-seq signal corresponds to bound Pol II in vivo and is not an artifact of the nuclear run-on (NRO) reactions in vitro extending beyond the 3’ ends defined in vivo (Figure 1—figure supplement 8A–C and Figure 3A). Third, a heat map of individual genes showing the GRO-cap signal relative to TSSs reveals that a dominant TSS contributes the majority of the vast GRO-cap signal (Figure 1G). Together these observations strongly support the argument that the GRO-cap signal paired with the continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines true TSSs. Recently published studies of TSSs in C. elegans that used cutoffs for TSS calls of either 1 kb upstream (Gu et al., 2012) or 200 bp upstream (Chen et al., 2013) of WB starts identified some outron TSSs but could not identify TSSs for a large class of genes with longer outrons (see ‘Discussion’)."

      "content": "(A) Trans-spliced genes can have multiple transcription start sites (TSSs), suggesting that trans-splicing eliminates the pressure to have only one precise TSS per gene. Shown are GRO-seq and corrected GRO-cap (TAP+ signal after subtracting TAP− signal) signals with ChIP-seq data of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II (8WG16 antibody, modENCODE_2439) for the trans-spliced gene sca-1 expressed in the L3 larval stage. The total GRO-seq signal becomes more intense as additional TSSs (from 5′ to 3′) contribute to the pool of engaged Pol II molecules that transcribe through the upstream regulatory region of sca-1. The combination of continuous Pol II signal in the upstream region and the lack of 3′ UTRs or polyA signals (Mangone et al., 2010) strengthens the interpretation that the GRO-cap signal combined with the continuous GRO-seq signal identified true TSSs for sca-1. From left to right, the TSSs reside upstream of the WormBase (WB) gene model by 5728 bp, 4582 bp, 3044 bp, 1669 bp, and 159 bp. The ChIP-seq signal 3′ of the sca-1 3′ UTR is from the klp-7 gene on the opposite strand. (B) A gene can use different primary TSSs in different developmental states. The primary TSS for tag-294 in embryos and L3 larvae is 1529 bp upstream of the WB start, while the primary TSS in starved L1 larvae is 656 bp upstream. DNA sequences flanking newly annotated TSSs have evolutionarily conserved core promoter elements, including (C) TATA-box elements and (D) initiator elements (Inr). Of 4547 embryo genes with TSSs, 162 genes (3.6%) have a TATA element with a perfect match to the consensus 15–45 bp upstream of it, and 745 genes (16.4%) have an Inr with the adenine residing at the TSS (+1 bp). Consensus sequences for TATA elements and the Inr are above the graphs. RPKM: reads per kilobase per million; RPM: reads per million."

The UCSC Genome Browser uses phastCons (http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast/) to investigate DNA sequence conservation across seven Caenorhabditis species. Values range from 0 (no conservation) to 1 (highest conservation) for each base pair. We calculated the average DNA conservation in a 2 kb window surrounding the new TSSs (top) and WormBase (WB) starts (bottom) and found substantial conservation in each location, likely for different reasons.

      "content": "Several other noteworthy features of promoters emerged from this comprehensive mapping of C. elegans transcription units and TSSs. (1) Many trans-spliced genes have multiple TSSs (Figure 3A), suggesting that trans-splicing has removed the selective pressure to form promoters with a single TSS. (2) Genes can use different TSSs across developmental stages, indicating developmental stage-specific regulation of transcription initiation (Figure 3B). (3) DNA sequences flanking the newly annotated TSSs have strong sequence conservation across nematode species (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) and also have evolutionarily conserved core promoter elements, including the TATA-box (worm consensus TATAWAWR) (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplements 1A and 2A,B) and the initiator element (Inr) (worm consensus YCAYTY) (Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 2C), both of which facilitate formation of the Pol II pre-initiation complex (Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010)."

(A) A histogram of the 3′ end pausing ratios shows 3′ accumulation of Pol II is more extensive in Caenorhabditis elegans than in Drosophila. The histogram compares 3′ accumulation for 3984 genes expressed in C. elegans embryos with 6107 genes expressed in Drosophila cell lines. (B) The GRO-seq signal surrounding the 3′ end (cleavage and polyadenylation site [CPS]) was averaged for genes in or not in operons. Genes at the beginning (n = 430) and middle (n = 276) of operons were more highly expressed and had higher 3′ accumulation than genes at the end (n = 474) of operons or not in operons (n = 5048). Genes plotted had to be greater than 3 kb in length. (C) 3′ End pausing ratios were calculated for all classes of genes in (B) and plotted as boxplots. For this analysis, genes had to be greater than 3 kb in length and the gene body RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) had to be ≥1. Genes found at the beginning (n = 415) and middle (n = 275) of operons had higher 3′ pausing than genes at the end (n = 467) of operons. Genes lacking a downstream gene had similar 3′ pausing ratios whether or not (n = 3670) they were in operons. The 3′ pausing ratios for genes in all classes were greater than for Drosophila genes (n = 3260). (D)–(F) Upstream divergent transcription is common at promoters of C. elegans genes. GRO-seq and GRO-cap profiles show transcription of a divergent gene pair (D) or divergent transcription from a promoter without an upstream divergent gene partner (E). Gene on plus strand (red gene and signal). Gene on minus strand (blue gene and signal). (F) Upstream divergent transcription from C. elegans promoters is intermediate between that in humans and Drosophila. Plot compares the log2(sense/antisense) transcription ratio of human and fly promoters to C. elegans promoters without divergent gene pairs. The median log2 ratios are 0.3 for humans, 2.3 for C. elegans, and 5.0 for Drosophila. RPM: reads per million."

The maximum average GRO-seq signal from control RNAi embryos was calculated across a 200 bp window at the 3′ end of each gene greater than 1.1 kb with an average expression of greater than 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase per million) in the gene body. This 3′ end GRO-seq average was compared with the average GRO-seq expression of the same genes in a scatter plot. The positive correlation of 3′ RNA Pol II accumulation and level of gene expression is reflected by the Spearman correlation of 0.776. (B) The 3′ pausing ratios are greater in Caenorhabditis elegans than in Drosophila. To calculate 3′ pausing ratios, the maximum average GRO-seq signal across a 200 bp window near the 3′ end was divided by the average GRO-seq signal in the gene body. The distribution of ratios from embryos, starved L1s, L3s, and Drosophila S2 cells was plotted. Although the distributions of all C. elegans states were significantly different from Drosophila S2 cells (Mann–Whitney U test, p<0.0001 for all comparisons to S2 cells), the 3′ pausing ratios got progressively smaller for the later C. elegans developmental stages."

For comparison of monocistronic gene sets, each monocistronic gene with trans-splicing had a monocistronic gene without trans-splicing of equivalent expression level. The first and middle genes in operons had the highest 3′ pausing ratio. Monocistronic genes with trans-splicing had a slightly higher 3′ pausing ratio than last genes in operons. Monocistronic genes with trans-splicing had a higher 3′ pausing ratio than monocistronic genes lacking trans-splicing (Mann–Whitney U p<10−10). The 3′ pausing ratios for genes in all classes were greater than for Drosophila genes. Monocistronic genes were classified as trans-spliced or not trans-spliced depending on whether an SL leader was identified in Allen et al. (2011).

      "content": "Pol II 3′ accumulation, likely caused by slow 3′ end formation and RNA processing (Gromak et al., 2006), is positively correlated in C. elegans with the expression level of the gene (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and Figure 4—source data 1) and is more extensive in C. elegans than in Drosophila (Figure 4A and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Multiple peaks of 3′ accumulation within a gene help identify genes having several isoforms with distinct 3′ ends (Figure 1—figure supplement 10D). The prevalence in C. elegans of polycistronic operons requiring extensive RNA processing to produce monocistronic mRNAs caused us to ask whether 3′ Pol II accumulation was positively correlated with the gene’s position in an operon and hence the level of RNA processing. First and middle genes in an operon require two forms of co-transcriptional RNA processing at the 3′ end to generate monocistronic mRNAs, polyadenylation of the upstream gene, and trans-splicing of the downstream gene, while the terminal gene requires only polyadenylation at the 3′ end. First and middle genes showed more 3′ accumulation than terminal genes or genes not in operons (Figure 4B,C). In other words, 3′ pausing is longer at genes with another gene to process just downstream. The 3′ Pol II accumulation at terminal genes and genes not in operons was equivalent, yet greater than in Drosophila genes. Lastly, 3′ accumulation was similar between terminal genes of operons and monocistronic genes undergoing trans-splicing, and both gene sets had greater 3′ accumulation than monocistronic genes lacking trans-splicing, which nonetheless had more 3′ accumulation than Drosophila genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Cues triggering trans-splicing, particularly operon-specific trans-splicing, appear to facilitate 3′ accumulation and perhaps predispose C. elegans Pol II to greater 3′ pausing genome-wide, whether or not a gene resides in an operon. It should be noted that Pol II accumulation at 3′ ends does not overlap with U-rich regions at 3′ ends. Therefore, the high GRO-seq signal is not due to selective enrichment of U-rich RNAs (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C)."

In C. elegans, divergent transcripts are short and initiated 75–150 bp upstream from TSSs of promoters lacking upstream divergent genes (Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C). The frequency of upstream divergent transcription in C. elegans appears to be intermediate in degree between that in mammals, where it occurs at the majority of active promoters (Kapranov et al., 2007; Core et al., 2008; Seila et al., 2008), and that in Drosophila, where it occurs only rarely (Nechaev et al., 2010; Core et al., 2012) (Figure 4F). For both mammals and worms, promoters with TATA elements rarely support divergent transcription (Figure 4—figure supplement 3D,E) (Core et al., 2012). These results underscore fundamental similarities and differences in the architecture, evolution, and function of eukaryotic promoters."

To assess dosage compensation, we disrupted sdc-2 (sex determination and dosage compensation), the central XX-specific factor that triggers assembly of all DCC components onto X and induces hermaphrodite sexual differentiation by repressing the autosomal male sex-determining gene her-1 (Figure 5A) (Dawes et al., 1999). Without sdc-2, DCC subunits fail to bind to X, and her-1 is expressed, causing XX embryos to become severely masculinized and die from overexpression of X-chromosome genes (Figure 5A). The pivotal role of sdc-2 in dosage compensation made its depletion the most effective way to disrupt dosage compensation, although depletion of any DCC condensin subunit causes similar XX lethality and elevation of X gene expression, as shown previously by our genome-wide measurements of gene expression (Jans et al., 2009)."

Without sdc-2, her-1 is expressed, causing sexual transformation of XX embryos to the male fate, and the DCC fails to assemble onto X, causing severe dosage compensation disruption and the death of all XX embryos. The DCC contains not only the X loaders (red, orange) but also five homologs of the mitotic condensin complex (yellow, blue, green). The DCC binds to the X chromosomes of only XX animals to reduce transcription by half, thereby equalizing X-chromosome gene expression between males (XO) and hermaphrodites (XX). (B) GRO-seq shows that both RNA isoforms of her-1 are elevated in sdc-2 XX mutants. her-1 is expressed at such a low level in XX embryos that the two transcription start sites (TSSs) are only evident with GRO-cap in the sdc-2 mutants. The gene model (red arrow) incorporates 3′ end data from Jan et al. (2011). (C) and (D) The X-linked protein coding gene pdi-2 is elevated in expression in sdc-2 mutants as is the gene encoding the mir-62 microRNA. For pdi-2, the elevation starts at the TSS and is evident throughout the gene. Red arrows show our re-annotated gene models. (E) The DCC subunit DPY-27 binds just upstream of the TSS. Comparison of the average DPY-27 ChIP-seq signal relative to WormBase (WB) starts and TSSs of X-linked genes. RPKM: reads per kilobase per million; RPM: reads per million."

      "content": "Genes were separated into different gene sets based on their length, origin, and chromosome (X vs autosome) to compare GRO-seq gene expression between the sdc-2 mutant and control RNAi embryos. Shown are the total number of genes, the median sdc-2 mutant/control RNAi expression ratio, the average sdc-2 mutant/control RNAi expression ratio together with the standard error of the mean, and the number of genes in each set that are more highly expressed in each condition. Across numerous protein-coding gene sets, the X chromosome is more highly expressed and the autosomes are slightly less expressed in the sdc-2 mutant. Furthermore, when X-linked genes are significantly changed in expression, they are almost exclusively increased in expression. Each gene set is separated into two sets, one containing all genes and the other containing genes that are significantly changed in expression as determined by analysis with DESeq (p<0.05) (Anders and Huber, 2010). For the first two lists (labeled with ‘≥250 bp’), average GRO-seq gene expression was calculated from the beginning to the end of either the WormBase (WB) model or the newly annotated transcription start site (TSS) gene model. WB genes had to be expressed at greater than 1 RPKM (reads per kilobase per million), and have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases in both sets. For the next set (labeled with ‘WormBase WS230 Genes ≥1.1 kb’), average GRO-seq expression was calculated for genes greater than 1.1 kb, with the first and last 300 bp of the gene excluded. The level of expression had to be ≥1 RPKM for WB genes, and have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases for a gene to be included. For the final two sets of genes (labeled with ‘≥1.1 kb’ and ‘≥1.5 kb’), expression was calculated for genes of the indicated length that have a newly annotated TSS, with the first and last 300 bp of the gene excluded. A gene had to have at least 250 uniquely mappable bases for it to be included. RNA polymerase II transcribed microRNAs are controlled by dosage compensation, while RNA polymerase III transcribed tRNAs are not. Average GRO-seq gene expression from sdc-2 mutant and control RNAi embryos was compared across ncRNAs. For microRNAs, expression values were calculated from the full length of the WB ‘primary transcript’ or re-annotated TSS gene models. For tRNAs, expression values were calculated from the beginning of the ‘mature transcript’ to 50 bp downstream of the stop. Because tRNAs are highly repetitive and transcription of highly transcribed tRNAs continues downstream of the stop, the extra 50 bp was included to increase the unique mappability of each tRNA. For a gene to be considered for analysis, it had to have at least 25 bp of uniquely mappable DNA, and to have an average expression of at least 1 RPKM in both control RNAi and sdc-2 mutant embryos. The median and mean sdc-2/control expression levels show that X-linked microRNAs are more susceptible to dosage compensation than autosomal microRNAs. X-linked tRNAs are decreased slightly in expression in the sdc-2 mutant, suggesting that its expression is not controlled by dosage compensation."

(A) DPY-27 has greater occupancy in the promoters of the more highly expressed genes. The scatter plot compares the log2 RPM of the DPY-27 ChIP-seq signal with the log2(RPKM) (reads per kilobase per million) of the GRO-seq signal from control RNAi embryos. The two are positively correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.428). (B) The level of DPY-27 occupancy in the promoter of the gene does not predict whether the expression of the gene will change in response to the disruption of dosage compensation. The scatter plot compares the log2(RPM) of the DPY-27 ChIP-seq signal with the log2(sdc-2 mutant/control RNAi) expression difference. No correlation was found (Spearman correlation coefficient of −0.003). RPM: reads per million."

Mapping of new TSSs relative to DCC binding sites called from our ChIP-seq experiments performed for this comparison showed the peak of DCC binding to be immediately upstream of the TSS (Figure 5E). Although the DCC binds to promoter regions, prior studies showed that DCC binding to a gene is neither necessary nor sufficient for the compensation of that gene, and not all genes are dosage compensated (Jans et al., 2009). We assessed the generality of that conclusion by comparing DCC binding upstream of a TSS to the increase in gene expression caused by disrupting sdc-2. Our results confirmed and extended the original conclusion (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A,B). Thus, the DCC can act at a distance to control gene expression, and DCC binding intensity is not a proxy for the dosage compensation status of the gene."

The change in Pol II distribution expected from disrupting dosage compensation differs according to the step of transcription affected by the DCC. If the DCC restricts Pol II recruitment, a uniform increase in engaged Pol II would be expected from the promoter to the 3′ end of genes of mutants. If the DCC reduces transcription by preventing the release of Pol II promoter-proximal pausing, or by reducing transcription elongation at stages downstream of the pause site, an increase in the level of engaged Pol II would be expected in the gene body and 3′ end in mutants, with the increase beginning more promoter proximal for a mechanism that controls pausing."

To determine whether control of 5′ pausing was a plausible mechanism for dosage compensation, we calculated 5′ pausing ratios (GRO-seq signal for 5′ end/gene body) for genes in each developmental stage using TSSs calls for the respective stage (Figure 4—source data 1). In contrast to Drosophila and mammalian genomes, very few genes (0.38%, 15 of 3975) of wild-type C. elegans embryos showed evidence of 5′ pausing (Figure 4—source data 1, Figure 6A,B, and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–D). The paused genes were not enriched on X (Figure 6C). Moreover, the number of 5′ paused genes was not decreased in sdc-2 mutants (Figure 4—source data 1 and Figure 6D,E)."

      "content": "Nonetheless, the GRO-seq assay is capable of detecting 5′ pausing in C. elegans, since genes not paused in embryos become paused in L1s deprived of food (Figure 6A and Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–C). In starved L1s, we found 7.7% of genes (166 of 2133) to exhibit 5′ pausing, and most were on autosomes (Figure 4—source data 1). A prior genome-wide analysis of Pol II binding in L1 animals cultured with and without food discovered an enrichment of Pol II only at some promoters of food-deprived larvae, consistent with 5′ proximal pausing (Baugh et al., 2009). Our results confirm their proposal that Pol II pausing can be induced by food deprivation. These cumulative results make it highly implausible that 5′ pausing control is the mechanism of X-chromosome dosage compensation in embryos, and they are consistent with the lack of a C. elegans negative elongation factor complex (NELF), which contributes, in part, to pausing in other organisms (Yamaguchi et al., 1999)."

Metagene analysis comparing the average GRO-seq signal from 665 X-linked genes ≥1.5 kb in control RNAi or sdc-2 mutant embryos. Genes were scaled to the same length as follows: 5′ ends (−1 kb to +500 bp of the transcription start site [TSS]) and 3′ ends (500 bp upstream to 1 kb downstream of 3′ end) were not scaled, and the gene body was scaled to 2 kb. The signal was averaged at each base pair and then averaged across 25 bp windows. The GRO-seq signal is elevated approximately 1.6-fold across genes in sdc-2 mutant versus control RNAi embryos (below). (B) The GRO-seq signal is decreased slightly across autosomal genes in sdc-2 mutant versus RNAi control embryos. Metagene analysis of 2949 autosomal genes ≥1.5 kb performed as in (D). The ratio of the GRO-seq signal in mutant versus control embryos is about 0.9. (C) Heat map shows that the GRO-seq signal is increased along the length of each X-linked gene in sdc-2 mutants. For each of 665 genes, the GRO-seq signal from mutant or control embryos was summed across 100 bp windows and the sdc-2/control ratio was calculated for each window. The log2(sdc-2/control) value was plotted across the scaled gene. (D) Heat map shows that the GRO-seq signal is moderately decreased along the length of individual autosomal genes in sdc-2 mutants. For each of 2949 autosomal genes, the log2(sdc-2/control) value was plotted across the scaled gene as in (F). (E) Dosage compensation does not specifically affect Pol II elongation. An elongation density index was calculated for each gene greater than 2 kb in length that did not have another gene on the same strand within 1 kb of the TSS. After excluding the first and last 500 bp of the gene, the average signal across the last 75% of the remaining gene was divided by the average signal across the first 25% of the remaining gene. Ratios of the indices between the sdc-2 mutant and control RNAi embryos are not significantly different for genes on the X compared to the autosomes. Error bars represent a 95% confidence interval for the mean indices. n = 481 (X); n = 1861 (autosomes). (F) Occupancy of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at the promoters of X-linked genes is increased in dosage compensation mutants, showing greater Pol II recruitment. Comparison of normalized Pol II ChIP-chip signal from control RNAi or sdc-2 mutant embryos relative to newly annotated TSSs of X-linked genes. (G) Sense and upstream divergent transcription are coordinately increased for X-linked genes in sdc-2 mutants. Comparison of average sense or antisense GRO-seq signal from sdc-2 mutant and control RNAi embryos for a 3 kb window surrounding TSSs for genes with no divergent gene partner. The GRO-cap signal was only evaluated in this analysis for genes having a log2(sense/antisense) ratio ≤1.5 in control RNAi embryos."

Together, these results demonstrate that the dosage compensation mechanism reduces X-linked gene expression in C. elegans hermaphrodites by restricting either the recruitment or initiation of Pol II. This conclusion is strongly supported by the analysis of elongation density indices (average GRO-seq signal across the last 75% of genes/average signal across the first 25%) in mutant vs control embryos for genes on X and autosomes. The ratios of indices between control and mutant embryos were not significantly different for genes on X compared to autosomes, indicating that dosage compensation does not preferentially affect Pol II elongation (Figure 7E)."

First, re-analysis of our previous genome-wide ChIP-chip analysis of Pol II binding (Pferdehirt et al., 2011) relative to the new TSSs showed an approximately twofold increase in the occupancy of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at the promoters of X-linked genes in sdc-2 mutant vs control embryos (Figure 7F). DNA-bound hypo-phosphorylated Pol II at promoters is enriched for non-initiated Pol II. The increase in Pol II occupancy at promoters of mutants (measured by ChIP) was nearly equivalent to the increase in post-initiated Pol II (measured by GRO-seq), indicating that Pol II promoter recruitment is rate-limiting when dosage compensation is active."

At those promoters, the level of hypo-phosphorylated Pol II was also elevated about twofold in mutant vs control embryos, as assayed by ChIP (Figure 7—figure supplement 4B). Since we found increased Pol II occupancy in mutants and observed virtually no promoter-proximal pausing in control embryos, escape from pausing into productive elongation, or any other form of post-initiation regulation, cannot be the cause of elevated transcription at the divergent promoters in sdc-2 mutants. Furthermore, an increase in transcription initiation by bound polymerases cannot account for these results, but an increase in Pol II recruitment can. Our combined experiments demonstrate that C. elegans dosage compensation controls X-chromosome-wide gene expression predominantly by reducing Pol II recruitment to promoters of hermaphrodites."

The answer to this question has been controversial, although evidence has mounted in favor of a mechanism to balance total expression between X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes based on measurements of accumulated transcripts (Xiong et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2011; Disteche, 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2013; Jue et al., 2013). Our GRO-seq experiments have addressed this question in the most definitive way to date by measuring the levels of nascent transcripts prior to co-transcriptional processing. We show that in wild-type C. elegans embryos, X and autosomes have nearly equivalent levels of total gene expression, and that levels of transcribing Pol II are uniform across X and autosomal genes (Figure 8A). In dosage-compensation-defective mutants, the level of X expression and engaged Pol II exceeds that of autosomes by 1.7-fold, from the TSSs to the 3′ ends (Figure 8B). These results demonstrate the existence of a separate mechanism in C. elegans to elevate the intrinsic rate of transcription from the X chromosomes of both sexes, so that after dosage compensation, X chromosomes and the two sets of autosomes have equivalent expression. Our experiments provide evidence that it, like dosage compensation, works at the level of controlling Pol II recruitment."

A major obstacle towards attaining this goal for C. elegans had been the lack of properly annotated transcription start sites for the majority of its genes. We therefore initiated our studies by developing a general and efficient strategy to map TSSs for Pol II-regulated genes with nucleotide resolution. This method, called GRO-cap, utilized purified nascent transcripts from the NRO reactions developed for GRO-seq and employed redundant enzymatic steps to capture RNAs with 5′ caps. GRO-cap tracks RNAs prior to their co-transcriptional processing. This approach was critical for our analysis because co-transcriptional processing removes TSSs from the transcripts of most nematode genes, including protein-coding genes and small non-coding RNA genes."

We found 5′ promoter-proximal pausing to be rare, unlike in other metazoans, and not likely to be the target of dosage compensation. Instead, dosage compensation reduces recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoters of hermaphrodite X-linked genes, thereby decreasing transcription from the two X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to the level of transcription from the single X chromosome of males. A separate regulatory mechanism elevates the intrinsic level of transcription from X chromosomes of both sexes so that after dosage compensation total expression from X chromosomes and autosomes is equivalent."

Most importantly, the GRO-cap strategy permits reliable assignment of TSSs by pairing TSS calls with uninterrupted GRO-seq signal for transcriptionally engaged Pol II between the GRO-cap TSS and the previously annotated 5′ end. Multiple lines of evidence showed that GRO-cap signal combined with continuous GRO-seq signal from WB starts defines true TSSs."

As a consequence, CapSeq did not identify TSSs for a large class of protein-coding genes. TSSs of small processed non-coding RNAs were also difficult to identify by CapSeq.

Based on comparison with our data (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 12A,B), we propose that a proportion of the upstream enhancer-like signatures are TSSs giving rise to full-length transcripts. Two clear examples of genes are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 12B,C, where the single TSS (either 2534 bp or 2878 bp upstream of the WB start) called from GRO-cap and GRO-seq data was classified as an enhancer by Chen et al.

However, in L1 larvae deprived of food, we found 5′ pausing at 7.7% of genes with TSS calls. A prior study using ChIP-seq discovered the accumulation of Pol II at promoters of starved larvae and proposed that 5′ promoter-proximal pausing was responsible for Pol II accumulation (Baugh et al., 2009). Our results confirm that interpretation. Two factors promote 5′ pausing in metazoans, negative elongation factor (NELF) and DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF), although the relative contribution of each is not fully understood (Adelman and Lis, 2012; Yamaguchi et al., 2013). C. elegans appears to lack NELF, suggesting either that DSIF is sufficient in the infrequent cases of pausing or that the core promoter complex (Kwak et al., 2013) or another not-yet identified negative elongation factor participates."

We found 3′ Pol II accumulation to be more extensive in nematodes than flies. Pol II 3′ accumulation is likely caused by slow 3′ end formation and RNA processing (Gromak et al., 2006). Because C. elegans has numerous polycistronic operons requiring extensive RNA processing to produce monocistronic mRNAs (Blumenthal, 2012), we were able to discover a strong positive correlation between the amount of 3′ Pol II accumulation and the amount of RNA processing. Curiously, though, even genes that were not part of operons exhibited greater 3′ accumulation than genes in flies. This observation raises the question of whether RNA processing in C. elegans is generally slower than that in other organisms to accommodate extensive trans-splicing, or whether C. elegans accommodates operons by imposing additional regulation on Pol II to enhance its 3′ pausing at all genes to assess whether to halt transcription or continue elongation."

If the DCC reduced X-chromosome gene expression by increasing 5′ promoter-proximal pausing, numerous genes on X would be paused in wild-type embryos, and disruption of dosage compensation would reduce the level of pausing. GRO-seq experiments showed instead that 5′ promoter-proximal pausing is rare in wild-type XX embryos. The few genes that exhibited 5′ pausing were not enriched on X chromosomes relative to autosomes, and the level of pausing was not decreased in dosage-compensation defective mutants."

      "content": "How might condensin reduce Pol II recruitment to the promoters of X-linked genes by approximately twofold? Our current and prior (Jans et al., 2009) studies showed that DCC binding to the promoter of a gene is neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit repression of the gene. Hence, the DCC influences gene expression over long distance, likely by imposing changes in higher-order chromosome structure. Clues to such a DCC function were suggested originally by the simultaneous discovery of the DCC and condensin’s biochemical properties in vitro as an ATPase that alters DNA topology (Chuang et al., 1994; Kimura and Hirano, 1997; Hagstrom et al., 2002; Hirano, 2012; Piazza et al., 2013) and its canonical roles in vivo of compacting and resolving mitotic and meiotic chromosomes for proper chromosome segregation (Hirano and Mitchison, 1994; Hagstrom et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2004; Hirano, 2012; Piazza et al., 2013). However, mechanisms of DCC function are perhaps best deduced from its non-canonical roles in vivo of regulating interphase chromosome structure (Bauer et al., 2012) and meiotic crossover recombination (Mets and Meyer, 2009; Wood et al., 2010; Aragon et al., 2013). Condensin II in Drosophila induces axial compaction of interphase chromosomes, globally disrupts inter-chromosomal interactions, and promotes dispersal of peri-centric heterochromatin (Bauer et al., 2012). These activities serve to compartmentalize the interphase nucleus into discrete chromosomal territories. Furthermore, nematodes carrying mutations that disrupt condensin I, which shares four subunits with the DCC, display elongated chromosomal axes during meiotic prophase and exhibit chromosome-wide changes in the distribution of double strand breaks and crossovers (Mets and Meyer, 2009), providing strong evidence that DCC subunits control intra-chromosomal structure."

Chromosome compaction and associated topological changes in DNA could broadly affect promoter accessibility of Pol II and the regulatory factors that recruit or stabilize it, thereby reducing Pol II recruitment in a quantitatively similar manner at different sites. Compaction of interphase chromosomal territories could reduce the local concentration of bound transcription activators and hence bound Pol II. Changes in intra-chromosomal interactions could alter the relationships between distal regulatory regions and their target promoters, thereby limiting Pol II recruitment. These and other models are topics of future studies."

      "content": "In Drosophila melanogaster, dosage compensation is achieved by the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex that binds along the single X chromosome of males to double transcription of X-linked genes (Gelbart and Kuroda, 2009; Conrad and Akhtar, 2012). The complex contains two long non-coding RNAs and five proteins, including the H4K16 histone acetyltransferase MOF (Hilfiker et al., 1997; Conrad et al., 2012a) and the H2BK34 ubiquitin ligase MSL2 (Wu et al., 2011). The MSL complex was proposed to regulate gene expression by controlling transcription elongation (Smith et al., 2001). This model was subsequently supported by genome-wide mapping of MSL proteins and MSL-dependent H4K16ac to the bodies of male X-linked genes, with a bias toward 3′ ends (Alekseyenko et al., 2006; Gilfillan et al., 2006; Legube et al., 2006), and GRO-seq experiments in S2 cells with or without RNAi of the msl2 gene (Larschan et al., 2011). While a recent study analyzing genome-wide Pol II occupancy in males and females by ChIP-seq experiments suggested an alternative view that fly dosage compensation operates at the level of Pol II recruitment or initiation (Conrad et al., 2012b), a mathematical computation error discovered in this study (Ferrari et al., 2013; Straub and Becker, 2013) rendered the results insufficient to distinguish between the competing models. The elongation model received recent further support from the discovery that dosage compensation is disrupted by impairing the function of SPT5, a transcription elongation factor that co-localizes with the MSL complex on male X chromosomes and interacts physically with the MSL complex (Prabhakaran and Kelley, 2012). Thus, the weight of evidence strongly favors enhancement of transcription elongation as the primary mechanism of fly dosage compensation."

Such chromosome sex-determining mechanisms had the potential to cause two problems in gene expression, an imbalance in X-chromosome gene expression between the sexes and an imbalance in gene expression between the male X chromosome and his two sets of autosomes (Disteche, 2012). X-chromosome dosage compensation strategies such as the Drosophila strategy solved both problems by doubling transcription of the single male X chromosome. An alternative solution would be to co-evolve two mechanisms, one to increase expression of X chromosomes in both sexes, thereby preventing hypo X expression in males, and a second to decrease total expression from female X chromosomes to prevent hyper X expression relative to female autosomes and male X chromosomes. Nematodes and mammals evolved the second strategy for equalizing X-chromosome expression between the sexes. It has been controversial whether these organisms also evolved a strategy to elevate X expression in both sexes and thereby balance expression between X chromosomes and autosomes (Xiong et al., 2010; Deng et al., 2011; Disteche, 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Deng et al., 2013; Jue et al., 2013)."

Our approach of examining nascent transcripts in mixed-stage embryos by GRO-seq conferred three advantages. First, it enabled us to quantify transcription specifically from somatic embryonic cells and thereby avert the complication of quantifying maternally contributed germline transcripts that contaminate mature embryo mRNA. Second, we could examine nascent transcription at a stage for which most germline-specific mechanisms of gene regulation would have been erased. Third, we could quantify transcriptionally engaged Pol II across the entire length of a gene, starting from the bona fide TSS, and assess the step of transcription controlled by the process. We found that a major part of the mechanism to increase X expression in C. elegans is to increase the level of Pol II recruitment to promoters, as was shown recently for mammals (Deng et al., 2013). Together, these results reinforce the evolutionary importance of balancing gene expression across all chromosomes of a genome."

This new analysis evaluated the original normalization strategy. Because expression of genes on the X chromosome is elevated in sdc-2 mutants, it is difficult to determine whether the autosomes are changed in expression in the sdc-2 mutant. The proportion of autosomal reads relative to total reads per experiment is lower in the sdc-2 mutant (75.9%) than in the control RNAi (85.7%). To normalize the autosomal expression between the two conditions, we divided the average expression of all genes in the sdc-2 mutant by the scaling factor of this difference (75.9%/84.715% = 0.885). We then investigated changes in the sdc-2 mutant compared to the control for our most inclusive gene set: WB WS230 genes that are >250 bp in length (see Figure 5—source data 1). With this alternative normalization, the median sdc-2/control gene expression ratios increase for both X (1.67 becomes 1.88) and autosomes (0.81 becomes 0.91). This procedure changed the proportion of X-linked genes that are more highly expressed in the mutant (genes increased in expression by 1.5-fold or greater) from 64.9% to 78.4%. The original normalization showed that fewer autosomal genes increase by 1.5-fold than decrease by 1.5-fold (5.2% compared to 26.7%, respectively), and the alternative normalization shows the same trend (8.4% compared to 16.5%). Therefore, the same conclusions about X and autosomal gene expression can be made with either normalization strategy."

We calculated TSSs in wild-type embryos, starved L1s, L3s, and sdc-2 mutant embryos independently. To do this, we utilized both our GRO-cap and GRO-seq data with the assumption that a true TSS would be supported by a continuous GRO-seq signal extending upstream from the WB start to the newly annotated TSS. To correct for background noise in the TAP+ GRO-cap signal, we subtracted the TAP− control GRO-cap signal from the TAP+ GRO-cap signal. The Z-score was calculated at each position on a chromosome using the standard deviation and mean calculated for that individual chromosome, ignoring the top 0.005% of scores as outliers. Removing these outliers was required so that the locations with the strongest GRO-seq signal did not markedly affect the standard deviation and Z-score. To prevent biasing TSS calls to only those genes in which transcription began at only one base pair, we averaged the Z-score data in a 10 bp moving window with a 1 bp step."

If the TSS of a gene was contained within the transcript of another gene or had another protein coding gene within it on the same strand, we did not consider it. This reduced our possible gene list from 20,516 genes to 20,008 genes. Within these genes, we searched for the highest 10 bp Z-score average in the upstream window and concurrently calculated GRO-seq signal across a 200 bp sliding window with a 1 bp step. If the average GRO-seq signal dropped below 1 RPKM, we did not proceed further upstream to identify a TSS. This step was necessary to eliminate TSS calls that were clearly not supported by GRO-seq data. After identifying the highest 10 bp Z-score average, we mapped the highest 1 bp Z-score within the 10 bp window to be called as the TSS position."

To confirm these cutoffs held true across the genome, a random set of 250 autosomal genes with a 10 bp Z-score average greater than the 90th percentile was investigated visually for the wild-type embryo data set. These genes had >90% agreement for TSS calls, confirming that the same cutoffs could be used for genes on both the X and autosomes. For TSS calls that differed by more than 2 kb upstream from the WB start, we inspected each gene visually to eliminate any TSS calls due to such complications as unannotated transcripts. In addition, for all genes that had an overlapping gene on the opposite strand, we verified each TSS visually. If no TSS had been called, but one could be identified visually with ease, we annotated the TSS. In a few cases, visual inspection allowed us to find a TSS significantly downstream of the WB-annotated start. The criteria used to accept the downstream TSS included a strong GRO-cap signal, no GRO-seq signal upstream of the GRO-cap signal, and no contradicting GRO-cap signal in any worm stage."

As the regulation of expression of many ncRNAs, particularly microRNAs, is essential for proper development, we set out to properly annotate TSSs for many small ncRNAs. We utilized the protein coding gene strategy outlined above to identify likely TSS positions for these ncRNAs. As relatively few of these small ncRNAs exist in the genome, we examined the predicted TSS of each ncRNA gene visually to confirm or deny the computational TSS or to call a TSS. Through these analyses, we annotated TSSs for 74/141 snoRNAs and 70/180 microRNAs, including the five polycistronic microRNA clusters (mir-35-41; mir-42-44; mir-229 and mir-64-66; mir-54-56 [Figure 1B]; and mir-73-74) (Lau et al., 2001).

There is little overlap between our set of genes paused during L1 arrest and those reported to have 5′ accumulation of Pol II. This discrepancy is due to the facts that the correct TSSs were not then known for many of the genes and that much of the Pol II accumulated at the 5′ end had not begun elongation and was therefore not detected by GRO-seq (R Baugh, personal communication)."

We used R to plot kernel density estimations of the log2 (sense/antisense) ratio for C. elegans, Human, and Drosophila. To determine how far upstream the closest upstream divergent gene was to each TSS, we searched for the closest transcript (protein coding, non-coding RNA, tRNA, or rRNA) upstream and antisense to the TSS. Prior to the search, the 6353 protein coding genes with new TSS calls were re-annotated with the most upstream TSS identified. To determine the upstream distance between the TSS and the start of upstream divergent transcription, we searched 500 bp upstream of the TSS to identify the position with the highest level of GRO-cap TAP+ minus the TAP− signal."

To account for read depth, the ChIP signal was normalized to the total number of millions of reads that uniquely aligned to the genome. To correct for non-specific binding, the IgG signal was subtracted from the DPY-27 signal. The resulting ChIP-seq signal from two biological replicates was averaged at each base pair genome-wide."

To identify a worm TATA-box, we searched for strand-specific motifs within a region 15–45 bp upstream of the TSS. To identify a worm Inr, we searched for strand-specific motifs within 10 bp of the TSS in either direction. These searches identified a TATA consensus of TATAWAWR, compared to TATAWAWR for yeast (Rhee and Pugh, 2012), and an Inr consensus of YCAYTY, compared to YYANWYY in humans and TCAYTY in Drosophila (Juven-Gershon and Kadonaga, 2010). To determine where these motifs lie, we calculated their distance from the TSS. For TATA, we calculated how far upstream the most 5′ base lies. For the Inr, we calculated how far the adenine lies from the TSS. In other organisms the adenine has been shown to be the +1 nucleotide in transcription; the location of the worm Inr relative to the TSS suggests that this is true in C. elegans."
