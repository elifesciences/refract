Here, we synthesized a new stimulus to examine the detection of coherent patterns (‚Äòfigures‚Äô) from overlapping ‚Äòbackground‚Äô signals. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of such figures and can tolerate a variety of spectral and temporal perturbations. This robust behavior is consistent with the existence of automatic auditory segregation mechanisms that are highly sensitive to correlations across frequency and time. The observed behavior cannot be explained purely on the basis of adaptation-based models used to explain the segregation of deterministic narrowband signals. We show that the present results are consistent with the predictions of a model of auditory perceptual organization based on temporal coherence. Our data thus support a role for temporal coherence as an organizational principle underlying auditory segregation."

When subjects are played a sequence of alternating high and low frequency tones, they perceive them as two independent streams of sound. Similar experiments in macaque monkeys reveal that each stream activates a different area of auditory cortex, suggesting that the brain may distinguish acoustic stimuli on the basis of their frequency."

These are often made up of multiple frequencies, and overlap‚Äîboth in frequency and in time‚Äîwith other sounds in the environment. Moreover, recent experiments have shown that if a subject hears two tones simultaneously, he or she perceives them as belonging to a single stream of sound even if they have different frequencies: models that assume that we distinguish stimuli from noise on the basis of frequency alone struggle to explain this observation."

Subjects were extremely good at discriminating these complex target stimuli from background noise, and computational modelling confirmed that they did so via integration of both frequency and temporal information. The work of Teki, Chait, et al. thus offers the first explanation for our ability to home in on speech and other pertinent sounds, even amidst a sea of background noise."

Although we do it effortlessly, the separation of such mixtures of sounds into perceptually distinct sound sources is a highly complex task. In spite of being a topic of intense investigation for several decades, the neural bases of auditory object formation and segregation still remain to be fully explained (Cherry, 1953; McDermott, 2009; Griffiths et al., 2012)."

      "content": "The most commonly used signal for probing auditory perceptual organization is a sequence of two pure tones alternating in time that, under certain conditions, can ‚Äòstream‚Äô or segregate into two sources (van Noorden, 1975; Bregman, 1990). Much work using these streaming signals has been carried out to elucidate the neural substrates and computations that underlie auditory segregation (Moore and Gockel, 2012; Snyder et al., 2012). In a series of seminal experiments, Fishman and colleagues recorded multi-unit activity from the auditory cortex of macaques in response to a simple streaming sequence (Fishman et al., 2001; 2004). For large frequency differences and fast presentation rates, which promote two distinct perceptual streams, they observed spatially segregated responses to the two tones. This pattern of segregated cortical activation, proposed to underlie the streaming percept, has since been widely replicated (e.g., Bee and Klump, 2004; 2005; Micheyl et al., 2007a; Bidet-Caulet and Bertrand, 2009) and attributed to basic physiological principles of frequency selectivity, forward masking and neural adaptation (Fishman and Steinschneider, 2010a). These properties are considered to contribute to stream segregation by promoting the activation of distinct neuronal populations in the primary auditory cortex (A1) that are well separated along the tonotopic axis (McCabe and Denham, 1997; Carlyon, 2004; Micheyl et al., 2007a; Moore and Gockel, 2012). Human imaging studies that directly correlated the perceptual representation of streaming sequences with brain responses also support the correspondence between the streaming percept and the underlying neural activity in A1 (Gutschalk et al., 2005; Snyder et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2007; Cusack, 2005). However, similar effects have also been demonstrated in the auditory nerve, suggesting that processes contributing to segregation might occur earlier in the ascending auditory pathway rather than be mediated exclusively by the auditory cortex (Beauvois and Meddis, 1991; Pressnitzer et al., 2008)."

      "content": "A major drawback of the streaming paradigm is that it uses relatively simple, temporally regular narrowband signals which do not capture the rich spectrotemporal complexity of natural acoustic scenes. Moving beyond streaming, Kidd and colleagues developed a spectrally rich signal referred to as the ‚Äòinformational masking‚Äô (IM) stimulus (Kidd et al., 1994, 1995, 2011; Kidd and Mason, 2003). IM refers to a type of non-energetic or central masking that is associated with an increase in detection thresholds due to stimulus uncertainty and target-masker similarity that is distinct from peripheral energetic masking (Pollack, 1975; Durlach et al., 2003). These multi-tone masking experiments required listeners to detect tonal target signals in the presence of simultaneous multi-tone maskers, often separated by a ‚Äòspectral protection region‚Äô (a certain frequency region around the target with little masker energy) that promoted the perceptual segregation of the target from the masker tones. Results demonstrate that target detection is critically dependent on the width of the spectral protection region, and the ‚Äòdensity‚Äô of the maskers (Micheyl et al., 2007b; Gutschalk et al., 2008; Elhilali et al., 2009b), and has been hypothesized to rely on the same adaptation-based mechanisms as proposed in the context of simple streaming signals (Micheyl et al., 2007b)."

Indeed, the ability of models inspired by such paradigms to explain segregation is currently under debate. Recently, Elhilali et al. (2009a) demonstrated that when the two tones in a streaming signal are presented synchronously, listeners perceive the sequence as one stream irrespective of the frequency separation between the two tones, a result that is inconsistent with predictions based on adaptation-based models. Instead, the authors argued that in addition to separation in feature space, temporal coherence between different elements in the scene is essential for segregation such that temporally incoherent patterns tend to result in a segregated percept while temporal coherence promotes integration (Shamma et al., 2011; Fishman and Steinschneider, 2010b; Micheyl et al., 2013a,b)."

(C) Ramped figures: stimulus comprises of 40 consecutive chords each of duration 50 ms each (like A) but the frequency components comprising the figure increase in frequency in steps of 2*I or 5*I, where I = 1/24th of an octave, represents the resolution of the frequency pool. (D) Isolated figures: stimulus comprises only of the ‚Äòfigure present‚Äô portion without any chords preceding or following the figure. The duration of the stimulus is given by the number of chords. (E) Chords interrupted by noise: stimulus comprises of 40 consecutive chords alternating with 40 chords comprising of loud, masking broadband white noise, each 50 ms in duration. In experiment 6b, the duration of the noise was varied from 100 ms to 500 ms (see ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô)."

We also show that a model based on the detection of temporal coherence across frequency channels (Shamma et al., 2011, 2013) accounts for the psychophysical data (Figure 3 and Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1). The work demonstrates an automatic, highly robust segregation mechanism that is sensitive to temporal correlations across frequency channels."

Hit rates (not shown) mirror d‚Ä≤ with listeners achieving mean hit rates of 93 ¬± 2% for the most salient coherence/duration combination. It is notable that the patterns were very brief (longest figure duration was 7 chords or 350 ms), yet very high levels of performance were observed (and without extensive practice). This is consistent with the idea that this task based on the SFG stimulus taps low-level, finely tuned segregation mechanisms."

Since ‚Äòfigure-absent‚Äô and ‚Äòfigure-present‚Äô signals were controlled for overall number of components (see ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô), a global power increase per se associated with the emergence of the figure, can be discounted as a potential cue. However, it is possible that the decisions of the listeners are based on other changes within the stimulus, for example, the emergence of a figure might be associated with a change in the temporal modulation rate of a few frequency channels. The purpose of experiment 2 was to investigate whether the detection of figures involves a specific figure-ground decomposition, namely whether the figure components are grouped together as a detectable ‚Äòperceptual object‚Äô distinct from the background components, or whether listeners were rather just detecting some low-level changes within the ongoing stimulus. To address this issue, we created stimulus triplets with different background patterns in which each stimulus contained a figure but where figure components were identical in two out of the three signals. Listeners were required to identify the ‚Äòodd‚Äô signal that contained a different figure from the other two signals with identical figures in this AXB psychophysical paradigm (see ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô for details). Results (Figure 2B) indicate that for the very short figure duration (4 chords, or 200 ms) listeners had difficulty with this discrimination task (d‚Ä≤ = 0.31 ¬± 0.18; not significantly different from 0: p=0.12, t = 1.72), but that performance increased significantly for a figure duration of 8 chords (400 ms; d‚Ä≤ = 1.75 ¬± 0.34) and reached ceiling for a figure duration of 12 chords (600 ms; d‚Ä≤ = 2.93 ¬± 0.26). This pattern of results indicates that figure detection in these stimuli is associated with a segregation mechanism whereby coherent components are grouped together as a distinct perceptual object."

The figure and background in the SFG stimuli overlap in frequency space, thus challenging segregation based on activation of spatially distinct neuronal populations in A1. Furthermore, the data clearly indicate that performance strongly depends on the number of simultaneously repeating frequency components, suggesting a mechanism that is able to integrate across widely spaced frequency channels, an element missing in previous models based on streaming. Instead, the psychophysical data are consistent with a recently proposed model of auditory object formation based on analysis of temporal coherence (Shamma et al., 2011)."

In our stimuli, the ‚Äòfigure‚Äô (defined by the correlated tones) perceptually stands out against a background of random uncorrelated tones. The temporal coherence model postulates that the figure becomes progressively more salient with more correlated tones in the different frequency channels. To measure this coherence, we computed a correlation matrix across all channels of the spectrogram. In principle, the correlation between the activations of any two channels at time t should be computed over a certain time window in the past, of a duration that is commensurate with the rates of tone presentations in the channels; this may range roughly between 2 Hz and 40 Hz depending on the experimental session. Consequently, to estimate the perceptual saliency of the figure segment in our stimuli, we computed the correlation matrix simultaneously for a range of temporal resolutions, and then reported the largest correlation values as explained in more detail below and in ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô."

Specifically, temporal modulations in the spectrogram channels were first analyzed with a range of constant-Q modulation filters centered at rates ranging from 2 Hz to 40 Hz (computing in effect a wavelet transform for each channel). The correlation matrix ‚Äòat each rate‚Äô is then defined as the product of all channel pairs derived from the same rate filters (see ‚ÄòMaterials and methods‚Äô and Figure 3). The maximum correlation values from each matrix were then averaged and was assumed to reflect the coherence of the activity in the spectrogram channels, and hence the saliency of the figure interval. Note that, as expected, the rate at which the maximum correlations occurred for the different experiments (reported in Figure 3 and Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1) approximately matched the rate of the tones presented during the figure interval."

A stimulus containing a figure (here with coherence = 4) as indicated by the arrows (A) and another, background only (figure absent) stimulus (B) was applied as input to the temporal coherence model. The model performs multidimensional feature analysis at the level of the auditory cortex followed by temporal coherence analysis which generates a coherence matrix for each stimulus as shown in C and D respectively. The coherence matrix for the stimulus with figure present contains significantly higher cross-correlation values (off the diagonal; enclosed in white square) between the channels comprising repeating frequencies as indicated by the two orthogonal sets of white arrows in C. A magnified plot of the coherence matrix for the figure stimulus is shown in E where the cross-correlation peaks are highlighted in white boxes. The strength of the cross-correlation is indicated by the heat map next to each figure. The stimulus without a figure, that is, which does not contain any repeating frequencies, does not contain significant cross-correlations. This process is repeated for 500 iterations (Niter) for all combinations of coherence and duration. The differences between these two coherence matrices were quantified by computing the maximum cross-correlation for each set of coherence matrices for the figure and the ground stimuli respectively. Temporal coherence was calculated as the difference between the average maxima for the figure and the ground stimuli respectively. The resultant model response is shown for each combination of coherence and duration in F."

Finally, as expected, model predictions were consistent with the experimental findings.

Performance was significantly worse for the ramp = 5 vs ramp = 2 condition (F1,18 = 21, p<0.001), but, remarkably, listeners exhibited above-chance performance even for the steeper slope. This suggests that the segregation mechanisms in question are more susceptible to spectral than temporal perturbations (as in experiments 3, and 6 below) but can still integrate over dynamically changing, rather than fixed, figure components. Finally, as with previous experiments, there were significant correlations among the channels predicting the saliency of the figure. However, the optimal rate at which the correlations occurred here was slightly lower (at 10 Hz; Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1B,C) than that of experiment 1 (20 Hz), perhaps because two 50 ms chords are integrated as a single unit to define the ramp."

We show that such figures can be detected as objects that can be distinguished, consistent with a high-level mechanism for object detection as opposed to the simple detection of frequency or modulation cues (experiment 2). The mechanism scales in time, in that detection depends on the number of components over time rather than their absolute duration (experiment 3) and can still operate if the object is defined by slowly changing frequency trajectories rather than a fixed set of frequencies (experiment 4). It is robust to interruption of the figure by interleaved noise (experiment 5) and can operate over a remarkably long timescale (experiment 6). Modeling based on temporal coherence demonstrated a similar profile to the behavioral results and constitutes the first demonstration of the compatibility of the temporal coherence model with segregation in complex acoustic scenes."

Specifically, the model incorporates two stages: firstly, a feature analysis stage that performs multidimensional feature analysis by distinct populations of neurons in the auditory cortex that are tuned to a range of temporal modulation rates and spectral resolution scales. Auditory features such as pitch, timbre and loudness are computed by different neuronal groups at this initial stage, the output of which is fed to a second stage that involves analysis of temporal coherence."

This was substantiated by direct neurophysiological recordings from ferret auditory cortex which showed that synchronous and alternating cortical responses were equally segregated despite their perceptual differences, and hence that the temporal factors are more important in inducing the one and two streams percept (Shamma and Micheyl, 2010; Pressnitzer et al., 2011; Shamma et al., 2011, 2013)."

The data suggest temporal coherence as a correlate of stimulus salience by which the brain picks out the most important sounds in busy auditory scenes: a process that may not be computed by dedicated structures but could be achieved by binding across distributed feature channels without significant changes in ensemble activity. Similar accounts of binding in vision based on coherence of the temporal structure have been put forward previously (e.g., Sporns et al., 1991; Alais et al., 1998; Blake and Lee, 2005)."

      "content": "Although previous brain imaging studies have identified activity in A1 that was correlated with the streaming percept (e.g., Gutschalk et al., 2005; Snyder et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 2007), we found no evidence of modulation of BOLD signal in A1 as a function of figure emergence in a passive listening paradigm (Teki et al., 2011). However, we found activity in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) to be strongly modulated by the salience of the figure, similar to the modulation of temporal coherence observed here. The IPS activation likely reflect bottom-up stimulus-driven processing of figures and is consistent with accumulating literature which suggests that areas outside the conventional auditory system, such as the parietal cortex may have a role in auditory segregation (Cusack, 2005; Dykstra et al., 2011). Although not relevant to the passive fMRI experiment (Teki et al., 2011), attention also influences segregation. In this regard, the parietal cortex is in an ideal position to integrate both bottom-up auditory input as it receives auditory input from the temporoparietal cortex (Pandya and Kuypers, 1969; Divac et al., 1977; Hyv√§rinen, 1982; Cohen, 2009) as well as top-down attentional input from the prefrontal cortex (Andersen et al., 1985; Barbas and Mesulam, 1981; Petrides and Pandya, 1984; Stanton et al., 1995). IPS is associated with both bottom-up and top-down attention and is a key structure implicated in saliency map models of visual search (Koch and Ullman, 1985; Itti and Koch, 2001; Walther and Koch, 2007) where low-level feature maps may combine with top-down cognitive biases to represent a global saliency map (Gottlieb et al., 1998; Geng and Mangun, 2009; Bisley and Goldberg, 2010). IPS (and its monkey homologue) has been implicated in mediating object representations, binding of sensory features within and across different modalities, as well as attentional selection."

Each chord contains a random number (average: 10 and varying between 5 and 15) of pure tone components. The spectral components are randomly selected from a set of 129 frequencies equally spaced on a logarithmic scale between 179 Hz and 7246 Hz such that the separation between successive components is 1/24th of an octave. The onset and offset of each chord are shaped by a 10 ms raised-cosine ramp. In half of these stimuli, a random number of tones are repeated across a certain number of consecutive chords (e.g., in Figure 1, four components marked by arrows are repeated across 6 chords) which results in the percept of a ‚Äòfigure‚Äô that readily pops out of the random tonal background. To eliminate correlation between the number of figure and background components, the figure was realized by first generating the random background and then adding additional, repeating components to the relevant chords. To avoid the problem that the interval containing the figure might, on average, also contain more frequency components, and to prevent listeners from relying on this feature in performing the figure detection task, the remaining 50% of the stimuli (those containing no figure) also included additional tonal components, which were added over a variable number (2‚Äì7) of consecutive chords at the same time as when a figure would have appeared. But these additional components changed from chord to chord and did not form a coherent figure."

This temporal integration is achieved through a bank of bandpass filters that are tuned to different physiologically plausible parameters that capture the rich variety of spectrotemporal receptive fields (STRFs) found in A1. This is realized by using a range of physiologically valid temporal modulation rates (from slow to fast: 2‚Äì32 Hz) and spectral resolution scales (narrow to broad: 0.125 to 8 cycles per octave)."

Additionally, we used a rate of 3.33 Hz corresponding to the rate of presentation of 300 ms white noise segments in experiment 6b. These rates cover the range of physiological temporal modulation rates observed in the auditory cortex. A single spectral resolution scale of 8 cycles per octave (corresponding to the bandwidth of streaming; 4 cycles per octave for experiment 4b where larger frequency steps are required to extract a ramped figure) was used."

      "content": "The analysis was conducted by entering the SFG stimulus for each experimental condition to the input stage of the model. For experiments 1 and 3, the entire stimulus duration was fed to the model input and for the remaining experiments a stimulus without the pre- and post-figure chords was entered. This was based on the prediction that the background chords before and after the figure onset contribute little to the cross-correlation matrix unlike the chords comprising the figure. The simulations were performed separately for the stimuli containing a figure and without a figure and repeated across 500 iterations. To establish differences between the resultant coherence matrices, we computed the maximum value of the cross-correlation across all time points. This spectral decomposition helps us to examine which channels are correlated with each other (hence, the channels with repeating figure components could possibly be bound together as one object, or the ‚Äòfigure‚Äô), and not significantly correlated with each other (hence, the channels with random correlation between channels may not be perceived as a single object). The difference in the average values of the maxima between the figure and the ground stimuli was calculated as the model response and plotted like the psychophysical curves to obtain model responses (see Figure 3 and Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1)."
