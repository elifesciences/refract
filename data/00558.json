In the presence of the disaggregating drug these proteins transit the secretory pathway. When the drug is removed these proteins form electron-dense plaques which we term staples. Unexpectedly, when initially positioned within the cis-Golgi, staples remained at the cis face of the Golgi even after many hours. By contrast, soluble FM-aggregates transited the Golgi. Staples and soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae therefore have different fates. Whereas the membrane staples are located in the flattened, stacked central regions of the cisternae, the soluble aggregates are in the dilated rims. This suggests that while the cisternae are static on the time scale of protein traffic, the dilated rims are mobile and progress in the cis → trans direction via a mechanism that we term ‘Rim Progression’."

To distinguish between these two mechanisms, they created a new type of protein cargo—which they called a ‘staple’—that became fixed to the walls on each side of the cisternae and could not, therefore, move freely through the Golgi. They compared the processing of this protein to that of a more typical soluble protein cargo, which could move freely through the Golgi stack."

The staples remained embedded in the walls in the center of the cisternae, whereas the conventional soluble cargo was transported past the staples and collected at the edges of the cisternae, which are known as rims. These are wider than the center of the cisternae, and the staples are too narrow to span them. Lavieu et al. suggest that the Golgi cisternae can be divided into two functionally distinct domains: the centers of cisternae, which remain stationary, and the edges or rims, which can move."

Despite the fact that this fundamental process was first recognized over 50 years ago, there is still today no general agreement on how it works. The greatest distinction among the competing models for anterograde transport (reviewed in Rothman, 2010) is whether the 4–6 cisternae typically comprising the Golgi stack are proposed to be static or mobile over the time scale of protein flow across the Golgi (typically 5–20 min)."

In order to allow the Golgi stack to retain its resident proteins (such as glycosyltransferases) in the face of continuous cisternal turnover, mobile/cisternal progression models also require concomitant retrograde transport (trans → cis or Golgi → ER, or both) of steady-state Golgi resident enzymes, termed ‘cisternal maturation’ (Glick and Malhotra, 1998; Glick and Luini, 2011)."

On this basis it has been widely accepted by deductive reasoning, as distinct from direct visualization, that whole cisternae must indeed progress across the stack. This of course does not rule out that parallel processes of COPI vesicular transport (Pelham and Rothman, 2000) and/or tubule-based transport (Trucco et al., 2004) could also occur."

For this purpose, we designed reversible membrane ‘staples’ loosely modeled on the adhesion protein cadherin, which can adhere cells homo-typically. Cadherins consist of tandem repeats of an adhesive unit that binds itself preferentially in trans (Pokutta and Weis, 2007). A similar unit, which additionally is controllable with soluble ligands that can enter cells, is the FKBP mutant termed FM, which according to its crystal packing also interacts in trans (Rollins et al., 2000), with the additional feature that this interaction is disrupted by ligands such as AP21998 even in living cells (Rivera et al., 2000). This suggests that tandem membrane-anchored repeats of FM domains should mimic cadherin in producing a defined structure (staple) that will reversibly adhere intracellular membranes when it faces the cytoplasm, or in the present application produce intra-lumenal adhesions within Golgi cisternae when the FM repeats are lumenally-oriented. To our surprise, we found that luminal staples and compositionally analogous soluble aggregates placed in cis-Golgi cisternae had entirely different fates. Whereas the soluble aggregates were rapidly transported, the membrane staples remained in place."

      "content": "As the basic unit of a lumenal membrane staple we designed a chimeric protein, termed CD8lumenal, that contained a signal sequence, for its proper insertion and translocation across the ER membrane, fused to 1) a fluorescent protein (GFP or DsRed) to track the protein within the cells by confocal microscopy, 2) four repeats of a domain (FM4) designed to self-aggregate in trans in the absence of the disaggregating drug (AP21998) (Rollins et al., 2000), and 3) the CD8 protein, known to be a trans-membrane protein ultimately targeted to the plasma membrane (Hennecke and Cosson, 1993; Lavieu et al., 2010). This CD8lumenal protein should initially reside in the ER oriented with its FM4-containing aggregation domain facing the lumen, and so long as it remains non-aggregated (in the presence of AP21998) should be effectively transported to the cell surface. On the other hand, if AP21998 is removed while in the ER—or at any later stage of transport through the Golgi—then intra-lumenal adhesions are expected to form as CD8lumenal aggregates homo-typically in trans, like a cadherin. These staples are expected to remain in the ER if they are planar and too large to be packaged into a small COPII vesicle. Various structural models suggest a planar adhesion plaque will form that closely links two sides of ER lamellae or tubules, with an intra-lumenal separation between the stapled membranes that from first principles could vary from 10 to 23 nm (Figure 1A), depending on the preferred arrangement of trans-aggregating FM4 domains. In particular, however, if repeat FM domains interact like cadherins (Miyaguchi, 2000; Pokutta and Weis, 2007) primarily via their most-membrane distant module (i.e., at their tips), then we would expect a membrane separation in the stapled state close to 25 nm (model 1 in Figure 1A)."

For the study of Golgi staples, after the radiolabeling pulse, cells were shifted to 16°C for 1 hr in the presence of the drug, after which the drug was removed and cells were incubated at 20°C. CD8lumenal from the cell extracts were immuno-precipitated using anti-GFP antibody, processed for SDS-PAGE. Lifetime was estimated by measuring the densitometry (using ImageJ) on a film exposed overnight to the gel containing the radioactive samples."

      "content": "We also employed biochemical tests of cell extracts to characterize the staples. When tested by SDS-PAGE, the disaggregating drug increased Triton-X100 solubility (without sonication procedure) of CD8lumenal in cell extracts by a factor 3.9 ± 0.9 (Figure 2C). Note that this relatively modest response of CD8lumenal to the disaggregating-drug (44% Triton X100-solubility after 4 hr treatment (Figure 2C) can be attributed to the transient transfection procedure. A large portion of the transfected cells showed a very high level of CD8lumenal over-expression, and did not respond well to the disaggregating drug. As a consequence CD8lumenal, remained aggregated in the ER even during drug treatment. This also explains the apparent moderate efficiency of transport of disaggregated-CD8 when measured by bulk assay (Figure 3B). Disaggregated CD8lumenal, expected to be O-glycosylated (Nilsson et al., 1989; Lavieu et al., 2010), appeared as an isoform with reduced SDS-PAGE motility (* Figure 2C). As expected, Jacalin, a lectin that binds D-Galactose residues, exclusively precipitates this isoform (Figure 2D). In addition, metabolic radiolabeling experiments showed that staples (∼5.5 hr half-life) were slightly more stable that disaggregated CD8lumenal (∼2.5 hr half-life) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Such stability is enough to guarantee the presence of the staples during numerous complete rounds of anterograde transport either from ER to Golgi or across the entire Golgi (around 20 rounds if we assume that one round of transport takes 15 min). Note that staples persist in the ER and in the Golgi (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) for the same time period (5–6 hr) before degradation by a cellular machinery that is not yet known."

A classic example is the 20°C temperature block, which slows exit from the trans-most Golgi cisterna (TGN) more than it slows ER → Golgi transport or transport from cis → trans Golgi (Matlin and Simons, 1983). As a result secretory cargoes accumulate in the TGN, from which they can be synchronously released by raising the temperature to the physiological value of 37°C. Temperature blocks in the 15–18°C range slow export of secretory cargo from the ER, but slow anterograde transport in the Golgi stack even more, resulting in limited penetration of the Golgi stack with accumulation in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) and the cis-most Golgi cisterna or two (Hobman et al., 1992; Balch et al., 1994; Volchuk et al., 2000)."

Surprisingly, the CD8lumenal re-aggregated in the Golgi at 16°C did not reach the surface and was retained in the Golgi as judged by confocal microscopy (Figure 3B,C, lane 2). Golgi retention of the staples is due to controlled aggregation, because this block to transport was removed when the drug was added back, and CD8lumenal (disaggregated) now moves from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (Figure 3B,C, lane 3). Note that except when mentioned otherwise, we used as a loading control 10% of the pellet fraction (insoluble fraction after sonication), which is almost free of soluble disaggregated-CD8lumenal (including the glycosylated-form). Again we attributed the apparent low efficiency of CD8lumenal transport to transient transfection. Cells that respond to the drug show >50% transport efficiency to the PM after 2 hr chase (Figure 3C, lane 3), consistently with the efficiency of transport of regular CD8-GFP (FM4-free) reported previously (Lavieu et al., 2010)."

We confirmed that co-expressed cis- and trans-Golgi fluorescent markers (Grasp65 and Golgin97, respectively) could be well discriminated by confocal microscopy and the degree of separation quantified with Pearson’s coefficient (Figure 4A and graph). As a negative control we showed that ER-staples did not co-localize with either the cis- or trans-Golgi markers (Figure 4B, 4 and graph). Using the same method we demonstrated that the initial localization of membrane staples Golgi staples formed at 16°C overlaps with the cis- but not the trans-Golgi marker. This co-localization with the cis- but not the trans-Golgi marker persists following warm-up to 20°C (Figure 4B, 2, 3 and graph), implying that the staples do not migrate in the cis → trans direction within the stack, even under conditions where this transport process is expected to resume. Again, the block to transport of the staples is entirely due to aggregation, because adding the drug to disaggregate the staples now allows transport and increased co-localization with the trans-Golgi marker following the warm-up to 20°C (Figure 4B, 2 and graph)."

As a negative control, cells were incubated at the same temperature but without any drug at any time (4). Confocal micrograph showed that Golgi-re-aggregated-CD8lumenal, presumably forming cis-Golgi lumenal staples, showed a better co-localization with Grasp65 (3) than with Golgin97 (2). Disaggregated-CD8lumenal showed a stronger co-localization with Golgin97 than with Grasp65 (1), whereas ER-aggregated-CD8lumenal is segregated from both Golgi markers (4). Graph, Pearson’s coefficient on the entire field of view, illustrating the co-localization between the different markers. The data represent the mean of three experiments in which a total of >20 fields were counted."

The staples were recognized in thin sections as electron dense plaques within Golgi cisternae (arrows, Figure 5A–C) spanning a gap of 27 ± 3 nm (Figure 5D) between opposing membrane surfaces, similar to their morphology within the ER. Staples formed at 16°C and then chased at 20°C for either 2 or 6 hr (which according to confocal microscopy remained in the cis-Golgi) were as would now be expected exclusively localized at one face of the Golgi, within the very first or more rarely the second and the third cisternae (Figure 5A–C and graph Figure 7C for quantification). Immuno-electron microscopy established that this face is the cis-Golgi since the gold particles recognizing the GFP harbored by the staples co-localized with the gold particles that bind GM130, a cis-Golgi marker (Figure 5E). Confirming this, the staples were at the opposed end of the stack from clathrin, which is a trans-Golgi marker (Figure 5F)."

We therefore wanted to see if staples deposited in later Golgi cisternae might also be static. To deposit staples throughout the Golgi stack we allowed CD8lumenal to enter the Golgi at 20°C in the presence of drug to maintain it in the disaggregated state. Then, the drug was removed at 20°C. Surface biotinylation established that staples formed at 20°C remained at the Golgi even after the cells were warmed up to 37°C for 2 hr (Figure 5G), similar to the cis-Golgi staples. Electron microscopy revealed that the staples formed at 20°C were present and retained throughout the entire Golgi stack, including the trans-most Golgi cisterna (Figure 5H). This is not surprising because significant back-up of cargo in the stack at 20°C has been previously documented (van Deurs et al., 1988)."

      "content": "To rigorously conclude that the staples are immobile during ongoing anterograde transport, we need to demonstrate positively that anterograde transport continues in the same stacks that retain the staples. To test this, we introduced a well-studied anterograde cargo into cells harboring staples, the VSV-encoded G protein. Specifically, we used a GFP-tagged version of a temperature-sensitive mutant G protein that is retained in the ER at 39°C, but which can exit the ER and be transported to the cell surface via the Golgi when the temperature is subsequently lowered to 32°C (Presley et al., 1997). In these experiments, the staples were labeled with DsRed (DsRed-CD8luminal) and co-expressed with GFP-tagged VSV-G. We estimated by confocal microscopy that >95% of the cells were co-transfected. We used the 39°C temperature block to retain VSV-G-GFP in the ER, then a fraction of both VSV-G-GFP and disaggregated DsRed-CD8luminal (+drug) were partially released into the Golgi at 16°C, prior to re-aggregating CD8lumenal (−drug) at 16°C into cis-Golgi staples. Only then was the temperature raised to 32°C for 2 hr to test the transport of VSV-G-GFP (the fraction localized into the stapled cis-Golgi and the fraction that was still into the ER). Surface biotinylation showed that the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells that harbored staples in their Golgi was 91 ± 12% of the amount of VSV-G detected at the surface of cells harboring a normal Golgi (Figure 6A). This showed that the stapling procedure did not interfere dramatically with the transport of classical anterograde cargo."

The rate of the release (half-time ∼ 5 min) of PA-GFP-VSV-G from even long-term (4 hr) stapled Golgi was indistinguishable from that measured from a non-stapled Golgi identified with a red-tagged Golgi marker (ST-RFP) (Figure 6B). This observation and the fact that stapled-Golgi remain properly stacked established that stapled-Golgi is fully functional for transport."

After transfection with GFP-CD8lumenal, Saos-2 cells were incubated at 20°C in the presence of the disaggregating drug, followed by drug removal to allow the positioning of the staples within the Golgi (Figure 6C upper panel, lane 1,2 show the glycosylated form of CD8lumenal). 2 hr after stapling the Golgi membranes, the culture media was removed and cells were incubated at 37°C in the presence of fresh media containing ascorbate to release collagen-I from the ER. After a 2 hr chase the amount of newly secreted collagen-I was determined by TCA precipitation/immunobloting procedure (Figure 6C). Cells harboring stapled-Golgi for 2 hr showed 92.5 ± 13% of freshly secreted collagen-I when compared to cells harboring normal Golgi (set to 100%). This suggests that, as reported above with for VSV-G, anterograde transport of Collagen-I is not altered when staples are positioned within the Golgi. To rigorously assess if Golgi staples had only minor effect on secretion, we further tested the rate of transport of collagen-I and MMP2, two proteins secreted by Saos-2 cells. The kinetics of secretion for both proteins did not show any robust differences whether the Golgi apparatus was stapled or not (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Again, this suggests that the amount of staples that is loaded in the Golgi membranes during the re-aggregation procedure does not poison the anterograde transport function of the Golgi."

Note that consistently with the moderate disaggregation reported above (44% solubilization in Triton X100), some aggregates remained in the ER (arrows Figure 6—figure supplement 2). These ER-remaining aggregates did not perturb the behavior of the Golgi resident enzymes (Golgi targeting and BFA-redistribution)."

This would explain in a satisfying manner why the essential functions of the Golgi (and ER) such as transport and glycosylation are not perturbed by the presence of the staples, since these behave like any cargo or resident protein within the membrane, as further evidenced by the re-distribution of staples (like any other Golgi cargo or resident enzyme) to the ER as a result of BFA treatment."

We noted that these soluble aggregates were concentrated at the rims of the Golgi cisternae, analogous to collagens. Given the prima facia contradiction between our current observation of immobile staples and our prior observation of mobile soluble aggregates composed of virtually the same protein, we repeated the earlier studies and compared the fates of soluble aggregates and staples in the same cells."

This would be expected because they share the same homotypic adhesion FM modules. As expected, when the two FM-containing proteins were present in the ER they were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated from cell extracts (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). However, when these same proteins were disaggregated and allowed to leave the ER and then re-aggregated for 1 hr in the cis-Golgi at 16°C, or even further in the Golgi stack at 20°C, the Golgi-modified forms of these same proteins were no longer co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). On the contrary homo-aggregates constituted of soluble cargo (hGH) were efficiently formed even after re-aggregation at 16°C or 20°C (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). This suggests that hetero-aggregates are not formed efficiently within the Golgi cisternae."

(A) Immunoblot, after surface biotinylation and TCA precipitation of the media, showing that DsRed-hGH is secreted regardless of its own re-aggregation status, or the re-aggregation status of CD8lumenal. Prior to being secreted disaggregated and re-aggregated DsRed-hGH are cleaved by furin. FL, full-length isoform of DsRed-hGH. FC, furin-cleaved isoform of DsRed-hGH. Graph, normalized quantification of PM targeted CD8lumenal (green bar) and normalized secreted DsRed-hGH (red bar). Data represent the mean of three independent experiments. (B) Cells were incubated at 16°C for 2 hr in the presence of the disaggregating drug, then the temperature was shifted to 20°C for two additional hours in the absence of the drug. Electron micrograph showing Golgi staples (green star) that remains at the cis-Golgi, which is adjacent to ER membranes, whereas the soluble aggregates (red star) is localized to the opposite face of the Golgi. (C) Graph, distribution of staples and soluble aggregates within the Golgi stack: cells expressing CD8lumenal or hGH were subjected to the re-aggregation procedure at 16°C, prior to being incubated at 20°C for 2 hr and prepared for classical EM. The distribution of the aggregates (soluble and staples) within the Golgi stack is shown as a percentage of the total in Golgi areas. (D) Electron micrograph showing segregation between Golgi lumenal staple (green star) and soluble aggregates (red star). Golgi staples form one flat feature in the center of one cisterna whereas the soluble aggregates form spherical aggregates that are localized at the rims of the cisternae throughout the Golgi. (E) HeLa cells expressing hGH or CD8lumenal were subjected to the re-aggregation procedure at 16°C for 2 hr prior to being processed for conventional EM. The upper panel shows the distribution of the soluble aggregates at the rim of the cistern, the lower panel illustrates the central positioning of the staple. Graph, lateral distribution coefficient (r) of staples and soluble aggregates within Golgi cisternae. The distances that separate the middle of the aggregates from each end of the cisterna (d1 and d2) were measured, and (r) was calculated as follow r = (d1 − d2)/(d1 + d2) with d1 ≥ d2.

On the one hand, because staples freely diffuse like any other membrane constituent it is hard to imagine how a moderate amount of staples would broadly perturb Golgi transport or function such as glycosylation, and there is no positive evidence from our studies that they do so. On the other hand, because they span and link between two sides of the cisterna, it is easy to see why staples should remain in the thin centers of the cisternae, far from the dilated rims (whose width is too great to accommodate the staples) where transport vesicles bud, and also why staples would be sterically excluded from budding COPI or other vesicles if they did occasionally reach a rim, and thus would remain within the cisterna."

In retrospect, the principal evidence for cisternal progression in Golgi stacks was the mobility of large aggregates like collagens that are located to the rims (Bonfanti et al., 1998). But in retrospect a stricter interpretation of that data would have been to conclude that the ‘at least some portions’ of the cisterna containing the collagen aggregates (i.e., the rims) are mobile, without reaching any conclusion with respect to the rest of the cisterna. A striking feature of the collagen data is that while the majority of the aggregates are indeed rapidly transported, a sizable minority (∼20% [Bonfanti et al., 1998]) remains in the Golgi cisternae, mainly in the centers of the cisternae, consistent with our results and interpretation."

Pfeffer has considered how this could be organized in the cis → trans direction by known Rab cascades in the Cisternal Progenitor model, which could well be the basis for the transport of rims dilated with aggregates. We would imagine that after fission a transiently separated rim would nonetheless remain in register in the stack because its membrane would still be engaged in stacking/tethering interactions. Pulse-chase experiments (Volchuk et al., 2000) showed the appearance of detached rims closely-associated with the edges of the stack that transiently appeared during the transport of soluble aggregates (which we termed mega-vesicles at the time). Retention of rims in transit would facilitate orderly rim progression."

We do not wish to conclude that cisternal maturation does not occur in the stacked Golgi of complex plants and animals, or that it may not be important in re-assembly of the Golgi after cell division, only that it does not appear to be required on the time scale of biosynthetic protein transport in interphase in stacked Golgi."

We propose that rim progression is dedicated to large soluble aggregates that due to physical constraints are forced into the rims away from adhesive centers of cisternae, and differs mechanistically from vesicle budding. COPI vesicles are known to bud extensively from the rims of Golgi cisternae at every level and contain–in addition to retrograde-directed cargo–anterograde-directed cargo such as insulin, albumin, and VSV-G (Rothman, 2010); so this biochemically well-understood pathway (Popoff et al., 2011) would seem to be the principal contender. There may well be other, parallel pathways depending on physiological state, specifically budding/fusing tubules, which have been observed especially under conditions of protein over-expression (Ladinsky et al., 1999; Trucco et al., 2004)."

Cells were scraped and re-suspended in 10% gelatin, then placed in cryoprotectant 2.3 M sucrose overnight at 4°C. These were transferred to aluminum pins and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen block was trimmed on a Leica Cryo-EMUC6UltraCut and 65 nm thin sections were collected. The frozen sections were thawed and collected on grids and floated in PBS ready for immunolabeling."
