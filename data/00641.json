Thus, our abilities to play a musical instrument, for example, or even just to reach for a cup of coffee without looking up from our computer, all depend on the cerebellum. One of the hallmarks of the cerebellum, which is hidden under the much larger cerebral cortex, is its simple, stereotyped architecture and well-understood circuitry. This simplicity means that analysis of the structure and function of the cerebellum offers neuroscientists the opportunity to understand the basic principles of cortical function."

First, it is able to compare sensory signals (which arise in sensory receptors and report what has happened in the outside world) and motor signals (which are corollaries of the motor commands sent to the spinal cord). Second, ‘plasticity’ in the cerebellum mediates the learning of motor skills. Here, plasticity refers to changes in the strength of the synapses that allow one neuron to communicate with another, or to changes in the number of action potentials emitted by a neuron when it receives a given set of synaptic inputs."

Mossy fibers originate in multiple regions, relaying motor and sensory inputs to synapses on the dendrites of granule neurons (Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974). The axons of the granule neurons ascend through the Purkinje neuron layer into the molecular layer, where they bifurcate into ‘parallel fibers’ and form synapses with the dendrites of Purkinje neurons (Figure 1). Tens, or maybe hundreds, of thousands of parallel fibers can form synapses with a single Purkinje cell."

Plasticity adjusts the strength of each parallel fiber input and attempts to create the correct commands for accurate, skilled movement. Indeed, when inputs from parallel fibers and climbing fibers arrive at a given Purkinje neuron at the same time, the strength of the synapse between the parallel fibers and the Purkinje cell is reduced (Ito et al., 1982; Linden et al., 1991). This reduction in the strength of the synapse is called ‘long-term depression'."

This raises questions about our current models of cerebellar learning. If learning occurs through changes in the strength of the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapse, then the early convergence of motor and sensory signals on granule cells means that the cerebellum may have limited ability to adjust the strengths of sensory and motor signals independently. Or, there might be a critical role for plasticity mechanisms at other sites in the cerebellar circuit (Hansel et al., 2001; Carey and Lisberger, 2002), even at the synapses between mossy fibers and granule cells."
