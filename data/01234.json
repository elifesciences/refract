First, vesicles filled with neurotransmitter fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic neuron and release their contents into the synapse. These neurotransmitter molecules can then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, enabling the action potential to be regenerated. However, the presynaptic neuron must also recycle those vesicles that have been released to ensure that the whole process can be repeated when the next action potential arrives."

Now in eLife, Tim Ryan, Pietro De Camilli, and co-workers—including Moritz Armbruster as first author—report that calcium entry during bursts of action potentials has an important role in optimizing the rate of endocytosis (Armbruster et al., 2013)."

Armbruster and co-workers—who are at Cornell University and Yale University—have now reconciled these results by carefully examining how the rate of endocytosis varies as a function of the number of action potentials delivered at a given frequency, referred to as a burst. They revealed that endocytosis slows down as the number of action potentials increases from 25 to 100, and that this deceleration requires calcium. This is in contrast to previous work, which found the rate of endocytosis to be constant over this range (Balaji et al., 2008). However, Armbruster et al. note that this previous study compared the ensemble average rate between boutons, and may thus have been less sensitive than their own study, which examined the rate of endocytosis within a bouton following differing numbers of action potentials."

Given that endocytosis slows as the number of action potentials increases from 25 to 100, they expected it to occur rapidly in response to a single action potential. On the contrary, they found that endocytosis was slow after a single spike, and accelerated as the number of action potentials increased to 25. It seems, therefore, that the rate of endocytosis shows a biphasic relation to the number of action potentials, with the fastest rate corresponding to an intermediate stimulation range (Figure 1A)."

(A) Schematic representation of the relationship between the speed of endocytosis, the level of intracellular calcium produced by increasing numbers of action potentials, and the signalling pathways activated by intracellular calcium when there is just a single action potential (i), a small burst of action potentials (ii), and a large burst of action potentials (iii). (B) Calcium levels are low when there is just one action potential (i), so calcineurin (CaN) is not activated, allowing Cdk5 to maintain high levels of phosphorylation of dynamin (P-dynamin). As the number of action potentials increases (ii), there are more calcium ions to activate the calcineurin, which results in a shift towards dephosphorylated dynamin. This can then bind to syndapin, and this interaction increases the rate of endocytosis. However, as the number of action potentials, and hence calcium levels, increase further (iii), a second calcium-dependent pathway with unknown molecular components is activated, and this reduces the rate of endocytosis."

This enzyme, which removes phosphate groups, and its counterplayer Cdk5 (which adds phosphate groups) have been implicated in the dynamic regulation of synaptic strength (Kim and Ryan, 2013)."

In an elegant set of rescue experiments, Armbruster et al. showed that the acceleration of endocytosis can only occur if phosphate groups have been removed from two previously identified sites on dynamin. Since dephosphorylated dynamin interacts with another protein called syndapin, which is also involved in endocytosis, they propose the following signalling pathway: The firing of multiple action potentials leads to a brief elevation of presynaptic calcium (Figure 1B (i)); this calcium activates calcineurin, which then dephosphorylates dynamin at two sites (ii); and a dynamin-syndapin complex then accelerates endocytosis (iii). Exactly how this last step occurs is unclear, although one possibility is that syndapin accelerates the recruitment of dynamin to sites of endocytosis (Koch et al., 2011)."

This suggests that the recycling of vesicles might depend on at least two separate calcium-dependent processes. One possibility is that endocytosis slows as the number of action potentials increases because the accumulation of exocytic proteins on the surface of the presynaptic cell leads to saturation of endocytic machinery, as previously described (Balaji et al., 2008). Moreover, because endocytosis still occurred in experiments where the dynamin phosphorylation state could not be altered, this pathway is likely not responsible for the calcium-dependent initiation of endocytosis (Gad et al., 1998)."

      "content": "Another intriguing aspect of these results is the potential for cell-type specific modulation. The acceleration of endocytosis with increasing action potential number in the small burst range could be regulated by a cell’s intrinsic calcium buffering capacity or its calcineurin/Cdk5 activity balance. Consistent with this, Armbruster et al. observed differences in the degree of regulation between cultures of neurons from different species and brain regions. Additionally, given that intrinsic firing patterns vary between cell types in vivo, it is possible that the standard burst size of a cell may define its baseline endocytosis rate. In conclusion, these findings add endocytosis to the list of dynamically regulated processes within synaptic transmission, which enable synapses to optimize information transfer between neurons in order to form networks within the brain."
