In particular, blood vessels are excluded from the cornea, lens and outer retina to prevent them from interfering with our ability to see. However, the outer retina is the most metabolically active tissue in the body, consuming more oxygen than even the brain, and the exclusion of blood vessels from this part of the retina has baffled vascular biologists for decades (Wangsa-Wirawan and Linsenmeier, 2003). Now, in eLife, Balamurali Ambati of the University of Utah and co-workers at various institutes in the US, Italy, Japan, Germany and China—including Ling Luo as first author—shed some light on this puzzle (Luo et al., 2013)."

This can cause the outer retina’s oxygen levels to approach zero (Figure 1). Low oxygen levels normally stimulate the production of proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that induce the formation of blood vessels and increase oxygen concentration. But this never occurs in the healthy retina, despite low oxygen levels, suggesting the presence of a powerful but unknown factor that can prevent blood-vessel formation."

The two components of the outer retina are light-sensitive cells called photoreceptors (blue) and the retinal pigment epithelium (black line below photoreceptors). Blood and nutrients are supplied to the outer retina by two vascular networks (shown in red), the choroidal (below the outer retina) and the retinal vasculature (above). The concentration of oxygen approaches zero in the centre of the outer retina (see graph on right; Wangsa-Wirawan and Linsenmeier, 2003)."

This protein, which is a shorter version of a protein called FLT-1 (a full-length VEGF receptor), is known to inhibit the activity of VEGF in other tissues. Whereas FLT-1 is a membrane-bound protein that displays signalling activity, sFLT-1 is free to circulate in the blood and interact with VEGF. However, since it does not signal, it inhibits rather than enhances the activity of VEGF, and therefore suppresses the formation of blood vessels."

Now they have turned their attention to the back of the eye and discovered that the retinal photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium can also produce sFLT-1. To test the function of sFLT-1 in the retina, they injected a neutralizing antibody into the subretinal space, the region between the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (Figure 1), in a mouse model. This led to the invasion of blood vessels into the photoreceptor layer, as did an alternative blocking strategy in which RNA interference was used to knock down sFlt-1 gene expression. Deletion of the entire Flt-1 gene in photoreceptors or in the retinal pigment epithelium also caused blood vessels to grow into the outer retina, indicating that sFLT-1 directly prevents VEGF stimulating the formation of blood vessels."

Luo et al. observed a reduction in sFLT-1 levels in the outer retina in post-mortem samples from patients suffering from wet AMD, raising the intriguing possibility that inadequate suppression of endogenous VEGF might contribute to AMD development in some proportion of patients."

The work of Luo et al. is reassuring, therefore, because it demonstrates that VEGF inhibitors occur naturally in the healthy retina, so it could be argued that treatment with anti-VEGF merely mimics what is already happening in the retina."

Gene therapy offers the possibility of sustained low-dose delivery, and trials that use adenoviral vectors to express sFlt-1 in the subretinal space, arguably the most ‘natural’ anti-VEGF approach, are currently on-going with patients who suffer from wet AMD. Luo et al. also suggest that sFLT-1 expression by the retinal pigment epithelium is directional, which facilitates its export to the adjacent choroidal blood vessels. This would potentially allow the development of strategies to target anti-VEGF therapies more specifically within the eye."
