      "content": "How do DNA transposons live in harmony with their hosts? Bacteria provide the only documented mechanisms for autoregulation, but these are incompatible with eukaryotic cell biology. Here we show that autoregulation of Hsmar1 operates during assembly of the transpososome and arises from the multimeric state of the transposase, mediated by a competition for binding sites. We explore the dynamics of a genomic invasion using a computer model, supported by in vitro and in vivo experiments, and show that amplification accelerates at first but then achieves a constant rate. The rate is proportional to the genome size and inversely proportional to transposase expression and its affinity for the transposon ends. Mariner transposons may therefore resist post-transcriptional silencing. Because regulation is an emergent property of the reaction it is resistant to selfish exploitation. The behavior of distantly related eukaryotic transposons is consistent with the same mechanism, which may therefore be widely applicable."

      "content": "Transposons are regions of mobile DNA that can jump from one location in the genome to another. This represents a genetic burden to the host because there is always the risk that the transposon will inactivate a cellular gene. However, a greater problem is that transposition is accompanied by an increase in the number of copies of the transposon. Since each new copy will be a source of further new copies, amplification of transposons is necessarily exponential. The fact that eukaryotic cells are able to tolerate DNA transposons suggests the existence of regulatory mechanisms to defuse the inevitable genomic melt-down. Host-mediated epigenetic modifications and RNA interference will provide some level of protection. However, they are by no means completely effective and a well-adapted genomic parasite, such as a transposon, might be expected to have its own mechanism of regulation."

      "content": "Now, Claeys Bouuaert, Lipkow and colleagues have used a computer model in combination with in vivo and in vitro experiments to search for this mechanism. Their experiments reveal how a DNA transposon is down-regulated by its own transposase. The transposase is the enzyme that catalyzes the ‘jump’ or transposition. It binds to specific sites at either end of the transposon and brings these together to make up a nucleoprotein complex called the transpososome. It is within this complex that the chemical steps of the reaction take place. When the number of transposons increases, so does the concentration of transposase. Claeys Bouuaert et al. show that the binding sites become saturated at a relatively low transposase concentration and that negative regulation arises from the resulting competition. Thus, the rate of transposition decreases as the number of transposons increases. They further use the computer model to explore how the amplification of the transposon is affected by transposon-specific and cellular-specific factors."

      "content": "Claeys Bouuaert, Lipkow and colleagues based their study predominantly on a resurrected copy of the Hsmar1 transposon, which was active in the human genome 50 million years ago. However, they also tested two distantly related eukaryotic transposons and observed that their behavior was similar, which suggests that this could be a general mechanism that controls the activity of jumping genes. They also note that their competition mechanism is conceptually similar to the immunological ‘prozone effect’. This is a recurrent theme in protein chemistry and demonstrates once again that less is in fact sometimes more."

They have had a profound influence on our evolutionary history by providing DNA duplications and rearrangements as substrates for natural selection (e.g. Hua-Van et al., 2011). Although retrotransposons, which transpose via an RNA intermediate, can persist for long periods in a given genome, DNA transposons appear to rely on regular horizontal transfer (Lohe et al., 1995; Hartl et al., 1997). In the period following horizontal transfer the transpositional activity of the element is under positive selection. However, once there are multiple copies in the genome, selection is relaxed because a freely diffusing pool of transposase acts on all copies of the element. Gradually, with time, as various copies of the element acquire detrimental mutations, the pool of active transposase is poisoned by dominant-negative complementation leading to the extinction of the transposon (Lohe et al., 1995; Hartl et al., 1997; Le Rouzic and Capy, 2005; Le Rouzic et al., 2007)."

This is a serious problem because transposition is inherently exponential and each new copy of the element is a source of further new copies. The fact that long-lived multicellular organisms tolerate transposons suggests the existence of control mechanisms. Host-mediated epigenetic responses may provide some level of protection. However, these are probably never entirely effective, particularly for euchromatic copies of the transposon (e.g. Kelleher and Barbash, 2013). Indeed, modeling suggests that unregulated transposition results either in the demise of the transposon or the demise of the host (Le Rouzic and Capy, 2005). Experiments with a non-autonomous Mos1 element in Drosophila provided the first experimental evidence of autoregulation (Lohe and Hartl, 1996). The phenomenon, termed overproduction inhibition (OPI), was revealed by a reduction in the frequency of excision when multiple copies of the transposase gene are present, or when transposase is over-expressed from a heat-shock promoter. OPI was later shown to affect other elements, both in vivo and in vitro (Lampe et al., 1998; Clark et al., 2009; Claeys Bouuaert and Chalmers, 2010)."

It is closely related to Mos1 and is a member of the mariner family, which is probably the most successful group of transposons in nature, as judged by the depth and breadth of its phylogenetic distribution (e.g. Robertson and Lampe, 1995; Feschotte and Wessler, 2002). The mariner family is a good model system to address autoregulation because of the demands placed by horizontal transfer on the mechanism of transposition and its control. Ideally, the mechanism should be independent of specific host factors and should allow a rate of transposition sufficiently high to protect the founding element from genetic drift. High activity also provides a high probability of integration into a vector, such as a virus or endosymbiont, which may mediate horizontal transfer. However, this must be balanced against a detrimental effect on host fitness (e.g. Le Rouzic and Capy, 2005)."

The model reveals how the kinetics of a genomic invasion are dictated by the multimeric state of the transposase and the order in which the various components are recruited into the developing transpososome. Once a certain number of copies of the transposon are established in the genome, and the transposase concentration is above a critical threshold, the mechanism provides a steady-state rate, perfectly damping the exponential amplification which is a natural consequence of unregulated transposition. The mechanism is an emergent property of the transposition reaction, based on the competition of active transposase multimers for their primary binding sites at the transposon ends. It is therefore robust and resistant to selfish exploitation. The key prediction of the model is that doubling the transposon copy number, which is tantamount to doubling the transposase concentration, halves the rate of transposition. In vivo transposase dose-response curves for Hsmar1 and the distantly related Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) transposons fit this condition, suggesting they are all regulated in the same way."

The cut-and-paste mechanism does not increase the number of transposons directly. Amplification requires that the empty donor site is repaired by homologous recombination from a sister chromosome, or that the transposon is excised behind a replication fork and integrates in front. However, unless stated otherwise we will assume a maximally efficient reaction in which each transposition event converts one copy of the element into two copies."

A kinetic diagram for the model is provided in Figure 1B. The first catalytic steps of the reaction are double strand breaks at the transposon ends, which are irreversible owing to the loss of enthalpy (subsumed into k3 in the diagram). Any regulation must occur before the formation of a productive synapsis because almost all transposons that achieve the first nick go on to complete cleavage and integration (Chalmers and Kleckner, 1994, 1996)."

In the bacterial elements Tn10 and Tn5 synapsis is mediated by the dimerization of monomers bound to either end of the transposon. T, transposase; T2, transposase dimer; A and B, transposon ends; PEC, paired ends complex. (B) The kinetic model embedded in the computer simulation for the S-PD mechanism of synapsis. Abbreviations are as given in part (A); Tfree and Tnsb, free and non-specifically bound transposase. (C) Simulation of the S-PD model. Kinetic parameters: k0, 9.9 × 106 M−1s−1; k−0, 139 s−1; k1, 3.8 × 108 M−1s−1; k−1, 1.2 × 10−2 s−1; k2, 12.7 s−1; k−2, 1 × 10−10 s−1; k3, 1.4 × 10−3 s−1. Sources of the values are given in Table 2. (D) As in part (C) but the transposase is 99% cis-acting. 1% of the transposase leaks into the bulk phase and acts on all copies of the element. (E) As in part (C) but the transposon expresses a trans-acting inhibitor which reduces the transposase concentration. The inhibitor is 1000-fold more active than the transposase, which approximates the situation in Tn10 where the inhibitor is an antisense RNA. (F) The cis-acting transposase and the trans-acting inhibitor from parts (D) and (E) are combined. (G) The mechanism of transpososome assembly in mariner. A transposase dimer bound to one transposon end recruits a naked transposon end. Abbreviations as in part (A). (H) The assembly-site occlusion model. When the transposase concentration is low, most transposons are occupied by only one transposase dimer, leading to productive synapsis (bottom left). When the transposase concentration is high, a transposon may be occupied by two transposase dimers, causing overproduction inhibition (OPI, top right). SEC2 is a transposon with a transposase dimer bound to one of the ends. (I) Kinetic model embedded in the computer simulation for the ASO mechanism. Abbreviations as given in parts (A) and (B). (J) Simulation of the S-NEC mechanism and comparison with S-PD. Parameters as in part (C). (K) The time scale of the S-NEC simulation in part (J) is extended."

At the start of the simulation a single transposon appears in the genome and initiates an exponential amplification (Figure 1C). Changing the values of the kinetic constants governing the model changes the scales on the axes but does not alter the exponential character of the reaction. Note that in this case the scale on the X axis is unrealistically short because we allow a productive synapsis to form products almost instantly (the value of k3 in Figure 1B is large). We are thus ignoring the time that would be required in vivo for the maturation of the integration products and repair of the donor site. This allows us to focus on the earlier stages of the reaction where regulation takes place."

      "content": "Amplification of the Tn10 and Tn5 transposons, which use the S-PD mechanism, is controlled by a combination of two effects (Kleckner, 1990; Reznikoff, 2008). Firstly, the transposases do not diffuse freely and tend to act in cis to the encoding element. This slows the amplification considerably because it prevents the effective concentration in transposase from rising with transposon copy number. However, it does not alter the exponential nature of the curve (Figure 1D). Secondly, the transposons express a trans-acting inhibitor, which in the case of Tn10 is an antisense RNA directed against the transposase mRNA. This strategy is also ineffective in dampening the exponential amplification, even if the inhibitor is much more abundant than the transposase (Figure 1E). In contrast, the combination of a cis-acting transposase and a trans-acting inhibitor is very effective (Figure 1F). This combined strategy is not viable in a eukaryotic host because of the physical separation of transcription and translation. Transposons using the S-PD mechanism would experience exponential amplification in a eukaryote."

Furthermore, several mariner transposases readily form a complex known as single end complex 2 (SEC2), which is composed of a transposase dimer bound to a single transposon end (Lipkow et al., 2004; Auge-Gouillou et al., 2005; CCB & RC data not shown). We would like to propose that SEC2 gives rise to the transpososome by capturing a naked transposon end (Figure 1G). We will refer to this mechanism as synapsis-by-naked-end-capture (S-NEC). Recruitment of a naked transposon end immediately suggests a mechanism that can account for OPI (Figure 1H). As the concentration of transposase rises, transposition is inhibited by the progressive reduction in the number of unbound ends available for synapsis. We will refer to this as an assembly-site-occlusion model (ASO). A kinetic diagram for the model is provided in Figure 1I, following the same conventions as before, except that T2 represents the transposase dimer."

Using an identical set of parameters, S-NEC has an advantage over the S-PD mechanism in terms of the rate at early time points (Figure 1J). However, as the invasion progresses, the S-NEC model is dampened by ASO, which eventually dominates the reaction (Figure 1K). The peak rate of the reaction is when the free-transposase concentration is equal to its equilibrium binding constant."

The simplest is that the rate of transposition is governed by the ratio of transposase to transposon ends, and not by the absolute concentrations. We tested this using the in vitro excision assay (Figure 2A, but please also consult Figure 2—figure supplement 1 for a guide to interpretation of the in vitro reactions). Excision of the transposon leaves behind the vector backbone, which is an end product of the reaction and provides a direct measure of the efficiency. With 10 nM substrate, the reaction peaked at 25 nM transposase and then declined sharply, as judged by the amount of backbone produced. When the concentration of substrate was increased or decreased by 10-fold, the amount of transposase required for peak activity changed in direct proportion. This is consistent with the ASO model, and excludes models in which OPI arises from a concentration-dependent mechanism of transposase aggregation."

The cartoon to the left of the gels illustrates the mechanism of cut-and-paste transposition using a supercoiled (SC) substrate. First strand nicking generates an open circular product (Nick.). Second strand nicking at one end yields the linear single-end break product (Lin.). A similar set of nicks at the other transposon end yield the plasmid backbone (BB) plus the excised transposon. Transposase was titrated into reactions with three different substrate concentrations. Reactions contained 1.5 µg of supercoiled substrate plasmid in a volume of 500 µl, 50 µl and 5 µl, which provided a final concentration of 1 nM, 10 nM and 100 nM, respectively. Transposase was diluted so that the addition of one tenth of the respective reaction volumes achieved the indicated concentrations. Reactions were incubated for 4 hr at 37 °C and deproteinated. Photographs of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels are shown. Consumption of the supercoiled substrate and production of the plasmid backbone both provide a measure of the efficiency of the reaction. Inter., product of intermolecular integration of the transposon into an unreacted substrate. (B) Preassembly of the paired-end complex protects from OPI. Four sets of staged reactions were assembled as indicated. Set A was a standard transposition reaction with 6.7 nM plasmid substrate and 20 nM of transposase except that the components were pre-incubated for 3 hr before the addition of the catalytic Mg2+ ion. Set A′ was identical except that Ca2+ was present during the 3 hr pre-incubation period, which enhances PEC assembly. Sets B and B′ were identical to A and A′ except that the mixture was supplemented with 50 nM transposase 30 s before the addition of Mg2+. OPI inhibited the reaction in Set B. In contrast, the stable PEC assembly supported by the presence of Ca2+ protected Set B′ from the inhibitory effects of the excess transposase added just before the catalytic Mg2+ ion. Photographs of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels are shown. See also Figure 2—figure supplement 1."

      "content": "The kinetics of the transposition reaction were analyzed in standard reactions containing 6.7 nM plasmid substrate and the indicated concentrations of the transposases. Photographs of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels are shown. (A) The effects of the ASO mechanism complicates the interpretation of the gels, particularly the kinetic analyses. In the reactions with 20 nM transposase about half of the substrate is converted to the nicked intermediate in the first 2 min. However, it takes an hour or more to consume the remainder of the substrate. This biphasic behavior arises from the ASO mechanism, which operates in any reaction that contains more than one dimer of transposase. Thus, even if the transposase was 100% active and the reaction was performed with the optimum ratio of one dimer to one transposon, only half of the substrate would react initially. At the start of the reaction half of the transposons would be occupied by a dimer and would react, a quarter would be occupied by two dimers and would suffer OPI and the other quarter would be completely unoccupied. The slow phase of consumption corresponds to the redistribution of dimers from transposons which initially suffered OPI to those that were completely unbound. Even under OPI conditions, when both ends of the transposon are occupied by transposase dimers, their occasional dissociation provides a window of opportunity for synapsis. OPI can therefore be overcome by extending the incubation period so that the accumulated windows of opportunity eventually suffice to complete the reaction. Thus, the reaction with 40 nM transposase goes on to reach completion during the 8 hr incubation, despite initially suffering from OPI. With 200 nM transposase, the extended incubation is unable to overcome OPI because the windows of opportunity provided by unoccupied transposon ends are shorter at this concentration. (B) The nicked substrate is more sensitive to OPI and is inhibited at only 40 nM transposase. This is because any free transposon ends, made available by the dissociation of a transposase dimer, are re-bound before they can achieve synapsis. In other words, the slow synapsis of the nicked substrate requires a longer window of opportunity than is available at 40 nM transposase. Time points and transposase concentrations as in part (A). (C) The RA104 transposase mutant is resistant to OPI because the higher OFF-rate provides more windows of opportunity for synapsis (see Figure 4C and text for details). Time points and transposase concentrations as in part (A)."

      "content": "Another prediction is that pre-assembly of the PEC will sequester the transposon ends in productive interactions, and protect the reaction from the subsequent addition of excess transposase. To test this hypothesis we measured the kinetics of four transposition reactions, which we assembled in different stages prior to the addition of the catalytic Mg2+ ions at time zero (Figure 2B). Set A is a standard transposition reaction in which the components were incubated for 3 hr prior to the addition of Mg2+. Set A′ is identical except that Ca2+ was present during the pre-incubation period. Although Ca2+ does not support DNA cleavage, it supports assembly of the PEC (Claeys Bouuaert and Chalmers, 2010). In Set A′ this is evident from the faster consumption of the supercoiled substrate. Upon addition of Mg2+, 50% of the substrate was converted from the supercoiled to the nicked form within 1 min."

As expected, this inhibited the reaction and very little substrate was converted into product. Set B′ is identical to Set B except that Ca2+ was present during the pre-incubation period, before the addition of excess transposase. The reaction kinetics were then identical to those of Set A′. Pre-assembly of the transpososome is completely effective in the relief of OPI because the competition for free transposon ends is irrelevant at this stage of the reaction. Transposition is thus regulated during assembly of the transpososome, before productive synapsis of the ends."

      "content": "We have assumed that each copy of the transposon contributes a certain amount of transposase to the nucleus and that this is where transposition takes place. We therefore estimated the rate of diffusion in this compartment and calculated its effects on the association rate constants for specific and non-specific DNA (‘Materials and methods’). Compared to the in vitro rates, the values were reduced by about twofold, but their effects cancel each other out and the rate of transposition is unchanged as a result. However, the effect of diffusion on the rate of synapsis is much greater because of the drag experienced by a chromosomally-bound protein. By treating the DNA with the worm-like chain model we obtained an estimate for ‘segmental-diffusion’, which describes the rate of motion on a short scale, such as the distance between the transposon ends (‘Materials and methods’). Our calculated value is consistent with the experimentally determined rate of looping derived from lox/Cre recombination in mammalian cells (Ringrose et al., 1999). When the calculated diffusion rates are applied in the computer model, a pseudo-steady-state rate of transposition is established when there are about 200 copies of the transposon (Figure 3A, compare with Figure 1K). This steady-state rate persists well beyond the copy numbers typically achieved during a genomic invasion (Figure 3—figure supplement 1)."

Other parameters were as in Figure 1K. (B) Transposase binds the transposon end rapidly and tightly. Binding reactions (20 µl) contained 40 fmol of 32P-labeled transposon end and 120 fmol of transposase. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C and separated on a native polyacrylamide gel. The lane indicated as time zero contains no transposase. The 30 s time interval was the time required to mix the sample, load the gel and apply the voltage. SEC1 and SEC2 represent a single transposon end bound by a transposase monomer and dimer, respectively. An autoradiogram is shown. (C) Binding reactions were set up and analyzed as in part (B). After 5 min incubation, to allow the complexes to form, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled transposon end ('cold ITR') was added. The lane indicated as time zero contains transposase but no cold competitor. The rate of transposase dissociation can be estimated from the amount of free DNA released from the complexes. (D) The rate of transposon excision from a nicked substrate provides an estimate of the rate of synapsis. The kinetics of a transposition reaction was analyzed in standard reactions containing 6.7 nM of nicked plasmid substrate and 20 nM transposase. A photograph of an ethidium bromide stained agarose gels is shown. (E) The ASO model was simulated as in Figure 1K but taking account of the effects of allostery, as described in the main text and ‘Materials and methods’. Parameters as in Figure 1K except k2 = 9.6 × 10−5 s−1; k−1 = 5.8 × 104 s−1. (F) As in part (E) but the rate of transposition is divided by the transposon copy number. (G) As in part (A), but taking account of allostery and slow diffusion in vivo: k0, 5.0 × 106 M−1s−1; k1, 1.9 × 108 M−1s−1; k2, 3.4 × 10−9 s−1. The effects of changing transposition efficiency are shown (see text for definition of efficiency). (H) The relationship between transposition efficiency and the relative rate of transposition is plotted with the maximum rate scaled to 1: y = 1.4427 ln(x).

      "content": "Transposon ends were encoded on radiolabeled linear DNA fragments. Binding reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 hr, separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and recorded by phosphoimaging. (A) SEC1 and SEC2 represent a single transposon end bound by a transposase monomer and dimer, respectively (see main text for details). SEC2 comes to dominate the reaction as the transposase concentration rises. There is a significant transition between 4 and 8 nM transposase when SEC1 largely disappears. This corresponds to the point at which the transposon ends become sub-stoichiometric to the transposase dimers. At this point no free transposon ends remain as they are all bound by transposase. According to the S-NEC mechanism (see Figure 1 for details), SEC2 is converted to the transpososome (=PEC) by recruitment of a naked transposon end. OPI occurs when the transposon ends are sub-stoichiometric to transposase dimers and there is a shortage of free transposon ends available for recruitment. Note that the various species observed in these binding reactions are identical to those observed in reactions with the related Mos1 and Himar1 transposons, which display the same behavior for example (Dawson and Finnegan, 2003; Lipkow et al., 2004). The present data suggests that the PEC in all three of these related systems is unstable in the EMSA and dissociates into two SEC1 complexes soon after the start of electrophoresis. Thus, in agreement with the S-NEC mechanism, SEC1 disappears at the point in the titration when the transposon ends become sub-stoichiometric to transposase dimers. (B) A fixed amount of transposase was titrated with an increasing amount of free transposon ends. The appearance of SEC1 coincides exactly with the appearance of the free transposon ends, which are required for PEC assembly in the S-NEC model. As the amount of transposon ends is increased further, the amount of SEC1 increases. This reflects mass action, which drives PEC assembly by favoring the capture of a free transposon end (see part D below for confirmation). This supports the data in part (A) in suggesting that SEC1 arises from the dissociation of the PEC. (C) Binding reactions were with a single-chain transposase dimer, in which two monomers are concatenated by a linker peptide joining the C-terminus of one to the N-terminus of the other. Concatenation of the subunits stabilizes the PEC, which is now detected in the gel. As the transposase concentration increases, the PEC disappears at the same point as the free DNA and gives way to SEC2. This behavior is identical to SEC1 in parts (A) and (B). The single-chain dimer of transposase is fully proficient for the transposition reaction (not shown), demonstrating that SEC1 is not an obligate intermediate of the reaction. This supports the data in parts (A) and (B) further confirming that SEC1 arises from the dissociation of the PEC. (D) In vitro transposition reactions were performed with a plasmid substrate encoding a single transposon end. Reactions were stopped at the indicated times and deproteinated before analysis on a 1.1% agarose TBE gel stained with ethidium bromide. All three sets of transposition reactions contained the same amounts of transposase and supercoiled plasmid substrate. However, the respective reaction volumes were adjusted to 500 µl, 50 µl and 5 µl to achieve the indicated concentrations. Transpososome assembly requires bimolecular synapsis between ends located on different molecules, as illustrated below the gels. This is inefficient owing to the relatively low concentration of one transposon end with respect to another when on separate molecules. When such a transpososome performs cleavage, followed by integration into an unreacted substrate molecule, the product is a linear molecule three times the size of the substrate (Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011). There is very little reaction when the substrate concentration is low. This reflects the inefficiency of second end recruitment. At high substrate concentration, mass action drives the reaction by favoring second-end recruitment."

      "content": "Up until now we have assumed that synapsis of the transposon ends is the product of two sequential, chemically identical, collision events: a transposase dimer collides with and binds first one transposon end and then the other. This system is useful to illustrate the fundamental dynamics of a generic DNA-looping reaction, and how it is governed by the concentration of the looping protein. However, the Hsmar1 transpososome is more complicated because of communication between the transposase subunits. The allostery was first noted in competition experiments using different topological forms of the substrate (Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011). The experiments revealed that transposase binds quickly and tightly to the first transposon end it encounters, but has a much lower affinity for the second transposon end (Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011). To see how this affects the rate of transposition we estimated the association and dissociation rate constants, and the rate of synapsis, in in vitro experiments. To estimate the association rate constants (k1 in Figure 1I) we used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Assembly of SEC2 was complete after 30 s, which was the minimum time required to load the gel and apply the voltage (Figure 3B). Although this did not provide a direct measure of k1, it was consistent with the rapid site-specific binding of a helix-turn-helix protein and we therefore retained the previous best estimate from the literature (‘Materials and methods’)."

The complex dissociated slowly and about 50% remained after 20 min. We therefore estimate that k−1 is 5.8 × 10−4 s−1. This is some 20-fold lower than the value for most helix-turn-helix proteins (‘Materials and methods’). It is possible that the slow dissociation reflects a second aspect of the aforementioned allostery. In this experiment we also observed single-end-complex 1 (SEC1), which contains a monomer of transposase bound to a single transposon end. It arises from decay of the PEC, which is unstable in the EMSA (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C). SEC1 is highly abundant in this experiment because the excess of cold competitor ends drives PEC assembly by mass action (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D)."

The highest rate of amplification, which we define as an efficiency of two, is achieved if, furthermore, the transposon excises after passage of a replication fork and inserts into an un-replicated region ahead of the fork. In this situation, one element on one chromosome becomes four elements on two sister chromosomes. The rate of transposition is quite sensitive to the efficiency of the reaction (Figure 3G,H). If the transposon inserts into a replicated region of the chromosome, or if the donor site is not reinstated, or if the excised transposon fails to reintegrate, the efficiency is reduced to 1.5 and the rate of transposition is halved. The rate of transposition may also be negative (Figure 3H)."

Increasing the affinity of the transposase for the transposon end reduces the rate of transposition, and vice versa. This is because the transposase acts primarily as an inhibitor of its own activity once the steady-state is established. In principle, this behavior could cause the preferential amplification of transposons which had acquired mutations in the transposase binding sites. However, when we reduced the association rate constant by 100-fold it was clear that the advantage was accompanied by a penalty in the form of a lag phase at the start of the invasion (Figure 4B). A low-affinity founding element would therefore be vulnerable to genetic drift during the period before sufficient copies had been produced to sustain the transposase concentration required for efficient amplification."

We have retained the effects of allostery but here and in subsequent simulations we have ignored the effects of the slow diffusion in vivo. This allows the algorithm to run more smoothly and shortens the scale on the x axis, but does not affect the conclusions, which are based on the differential responses to changing the various parameters. (B) Simulation as in part (A) (solid line), with k1 100-fold down. (C) Binding reactions with the RA104 mutant transposase were set up as in Figure 3B. In the lane with 20 nM transposase the smear between SEC2 and the position of free DNA is probably due to complexes that have dissociated during electrophoresis. Autoradiogram of an EMSA is shown. (D) The kinetics of the transposition reaction were analyzed in standard reactions containing 6.7 nM of supercoiled plasmid substrate and the indicated concentrations of the transposases. Photographs of ethidium bromide stained agarose gels are shown. With 200 nM wild-type transposase, the windows of opportunity for synapsis, provided by periods when one transposon end is unoccupied, are too short to allow for synapsis. The RA104 transposase mutant is resistant to OPI because the higher dissociating rate provides more windows of opportunity for synapsis. (E) Mutant and wild type transposase were assayed in HeLa cell culture with 8 ng or 1000 ng of helper plasmid and 500 ng of neomycin resistant reporter plasmid."

The RA104 mutation is located within the second helix-turn-helix motif, and abolishes an ionic interaction with the phosphodiester backbone (Roman et al., 2007; Richardson et al., 2009). In the EMSA the RA104 transposase produced very little SEC2, even when the standard transposase concentration was increased threefold (Figure 4C, compare with Figure 3B). However, in the in vitro plasmid transposition assay, RA104 consumed the supercoiled substrate faster than wild type (Figure 4D). Presumably, the mutant protein redistributes more quickly from those plasmids initially suffering OPI due to the double occupancy of their transposon ends. When the transposase concentration was increased 10-fold the wild type activity was almost abolished, whereas the mutant was almost unaffected (Figure 4D)."

It is based on the co-transfection of a helper plasmid, expressing transposase, and a reporter plasmid, encoding a transposon that confers neomycin resistance when it integrates into a host chromosome (e.g. [Grabundzija et al., 2010]). The rate of transposition is given by the number of stable transfectants obtained after drug selection. With the optimum amount of helper plasmid RA104 was only 25% as active as wild type. However, with higher levels RA104 was less severely inhibited (Figure 4E). Thus, the RA104 transposase reflects the behavior of the low affinity element in Figure 4B, which is at a disadvantage to wild type when the transposase concentration is low."

With a given set of kinetic parameters for transposase binding and synapsis, the actual rate achieved depends on the amount of transposase expressed by each copy of the transposon (Figure 5A). Reducing the expression level by fivefold increases the steady-state rate by the same factor. However, it takes slightly longer to establish the final rate because of the difficulty locating the transposon ends at the start of the invasion when the transposase concentration is low. The limits of this effect are reached when the expression of transposase dimers is fractionally sub-stoichiometric to transposon ends (Figure 5B). Since ASO requires at least two dimers per transposon, the accelerating phase is never dampened and amplification, although slow at first, is exponential."

Transposase expression increased throughout the titration. This indicates that transposase expression is not toxic.

This revealed an inverse-exponential relationship between transposase expression and the rate of transposition. This is noteworthy because it suggests that once the steady-state is established, a post-transcriptional silencing response may potentiate the genomic invasion. It also suggests that titration of the transposase by non-autonomous elements may not contribute to the demise of a transposon as has been previously suggested."

A Western blot was used to confirm that transposase expression increased with increasing amounts of helper plasmid (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). We also examined the transposase dose-response relationships for two other eukaryotic DNA transposons (Figure 5E,F). Sleeping Beauty (SB) is distantly related to Hsmar1 within the mariner/Tc1 superfamily (Goodier and Davidson, 1994; Ivics et al., 1997). The lepidopteran transposon piggyBac is very distant from Hsmar1 (Fraser et al., 1996). In both cases the transposase dose-response curve matched the predicted power law relationship."

This is a result of the inverse relationship between the transposase concentration and the rate of transposition, which was verified in Figure 5D. The effect arises from the facts that the number of non-specific binding sites scales with the genomes size, and that these relieve OPI by absorbing free transposase. Whether or not non-specific sites are composed of DNA or chromatin does not matter. The ASO mechanism thus tailors the rate of transposition according to the genome size. The S-PD model responds in the opposite direction, and smaller genomes receive progressively higher rates of transposition (Figure 6D)."

To investigate the behavior of such a system, we introduced an inhibitory binding site into the S-NEC reaction scheme (Figure 7A). The steady-state rate of transposition was reduced in proportion to the binding affinity of the transposase. Note that the behavior of the system would be identical if the transposon instead expressed a transposase variant or a completely different protein, provided that binding interfered with transposition."

(B) The dimerization end occlusion model for OPI. (C) All possible states of the DEO model are illustrated. A and B are transposon ends, T is an active transposase monomer, T2 is an inhibitory transposase dimer. Solid lines indicate reaction pathways allowed in the model. The active species is shown in red. (D) Simulation of the DEO model using in vitro, non-allosteric parameters as in Figure 1C. Inhibitory dimers bind transposon ends with the same affinity as the active monomers. Active monomers dimerize with the same affinity as they bind transposon ends. (E) DEO model as in part (D) but with in vivo slow diffusion rate as in Figure 3E. Affinity of the monomers in the inhibitory dimer is doubled as indicated. (F) DEO model as in part (E) showing the effect of doubling in the genome size and nuclear volume. (G) DEO model as in part (E) showing the effect of changing the association rate constant of the active monomers and the inhibitory dimers by the indicated amount."

This highlights the weakness of ‘secondary site’ models for regulation in the absence of the dose-dependent inhibition provided by the ASO mechanism."

The model postulates an S-PD mechanism of transpososome assembly, accompanied by the concentration-dependent formation of inactive dimers, which bind and occlude the transposon ends (Figure 7B). Tn5 was later shown to be regulated by other factors (above), and the current biochemical analysis excludes the DEO mechanism for mariner transposition. Nevertheless, DEO is a viable model and we wished to explore its properties: firstly to compare them with ASO, and, secondly, to facilitate its recognition should it be present in any natural element that may be characterized in the future."

      "content": "All potential states of the DEO model are illustrated in Figure 7C. However, in constructing a computer model we used a slightly simplified version in which only free monomers produce inactive dimers. In this scheme there is a single potentially active species, shown in red. As previously demonstrated, the model provides the dose-dependent inhibition needed to prevent exponential amplification (Townsend and Hartl, 2000; Figure 7D,E). The eventual steady-state rate is inversely proportional to the stability of the inhibitory dimer (Figure 7E). As in the ASO model, the steady-state rate is also proportional to the genome size (Figure 7F). However, larger genomes experience a longer lag phase at the start of the invasion. This is an inherent disadvantage of the S-PD mechanism of transpososome assembly and reflects the improbability of transposase monomers binding to both ends of the element simultaneously when their concentration is low (Figure 1J). Interestingly, once established, the steady state rate is independent of the association and dissociation rate constants, k1 and k−1, provided that dimerization does not change either of these values (Figure 7G and not shown)."

      "content": "DNA transposons require regulation to balance their fitness at different stages of a genomic invasion (Le Rouzic and Capy, 2005). Initially, a high rate of transposition is desirable as it guards against genetic drift. Later, as the copy number rises, a progressively lower activity per element would prevent excessive damage to the host (e.g. Townsend and Hartl, 2000; Le Rouzic and Capy, 2005). In the ASO model for mariner transposition, the rate of the reaction increases faster than the copy number at the start of a genomic invasion (Figure 3A,G,E). However, later when a number of copies exist in the genome, and the transposase concentration is above a certain threshold, the increased transpositional activity provided by each new copy is almost exactly balanced by the increased competition for binding sites at the transposon ends (Figure 3E,F). We note that the competition is conceptually similar to the immunological prozone phenomenon, which has been predicted to apply widely in biological systems that involve bridging interactions (Bray and Lay, 1997)."

It is also detrimental to the host, particularly in organisms where there is a risk of cancer. Furthermore, since somatic cells may spend a long time in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, when double strand breaks are processed by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), transposition may cause a net decrease in the number of transposon copies in the event of a failure to reintegrate (Figure 3H). The only selective advantage of transposition in soma that we can envisage is that it provides an opportunity for integration into a vector, which may mediate horizontal transfer. Indeed, mariner transposes readily in the soma and is among the most widespread of elements in nature. In contrast, the P element has a limited phylogenetic distribution and its activity is restricted to the germ line (Engels, 1983)."

Synchronization of transposition with S phase of the cell cycle would provide a further advantage due to the general up-regulation of homologous recombination and the chance of integrating ahead of a replication fork. This strategy was first observed in the bacterial IS10 (Roberts et al., 1985). P element transposition may also be linked to the cell cycle because it preferentially integrates near origins of replication, which will ensure its early replication (Spradling et al., 2011). A counter example is that expression of SB transposase is reported to extend G1 and promote the repair of excision sites by NHEJ in the soma (Walisko et al., 2006). It is unknown whether mariner transposition is synchronized with the cell cycle. However, this seems plausible because Hsmar1 transposition is greatly stimulated by negative supercoiling (Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011), which probably exists transiently behind an advancing replication fork."

      "content": "The values of the kinetic parameters determine the magnitude of the steady-state rate of transposition as well as the copy number at which it is achieved. The rate of synapsis is a dominant factor, and is in turn influenced by the multimeric state of the transposase, the rate of diffusion and, in the case of Hsmar1, by the allostery between the subunits. At the start of an invasion, a preformed transposase multimer overcomes the improbability of two monomers simultaneously binding opposite ends of the same element when their concentration is low. The advantage arises from the continuity of the DNA between the transposon ends, which ensures that the first dimer-bound-site has a high concentration with respect to its partner. The molar concentration of one DNA site with respect to another is abbreviated as jM, and is about 55 nM for the ends of a 1.3 kb transposon, such as Hsmar1. The magnitude of this value dictates the effectiveness of the ASO mechanism. In dilute solutions, where synapsis is fast, OPI is not significant until the free transposase concentration is a significant fraction of jM. This is evident in Figure 1K where 50% inhibition is not achieved until there are 107 copies of the transposon, which corresponds to 40 haploid human-genomes of DNA. However, under the slow diffusion regime that prevails in vivo, OPI becomes significant much earlier, and the steady state is achieved when there are about 200 copies of the transposon (Figure 3A). Allostery further increases the effectiveness of ASO by reducing the affinity of the developing transpososome for the second transposon end. This increases the competition for binding sites to such an extent that the steady-state rate is established when there are only a few copies of the transposon (Figure 3G)."

However, these relationships have additional complexities. Osmar14 is an autonomous transposon in the rice genome and provides the cognate transposase for Ost35, a more numerous miniature element (Yang et al., 2009). This relationship is not obvious from a comparison of the respective transposon end sequences, which appear quite divergent. Our finding that OPI is relieved by reducing the affinity between the transposase and the transposon end provides a further explanation for the unexpected efficiency of this cross-mobilization in addition to their short length (Figure 4A)."

However, as noted already, a repressive binding site such as this does not change the underlying dynamics of ASO (Figure 7A), nor does it dampen exponential amplification in the absence of ASO or a similarly effective mechanism (Figure 1E). Another type of secondary-site model is one in which transposase represses its own expression. This is conceptually similar to the cis-action observed in some bacterial systems, in that it prevents the concentration of transposase rising in proportion to the transposon copy number. The weakness of such models is that they only prevent the transposase concentration from rising and can never cause a reduction (Townsend and Hartl, 2000). For example, expression of the P element transposase in the soma is repressed in part by binding of a truncated splice variant. However, co-expression of the truncated transposase with the full-length version in the germ line is not sufficient to establish the repressive P-cytotype, which probably requires piwi RNA arising from specific telomeric copies of the element (Misra and Rio, 1990; Brennecke et al., 2008; Jensen et al., 2008)."

      "content": "A more general argument against the effectiveness of ‘secondary-site’ models is that they are vulnerable to selfish exploitation by any element that lacks the site. Thus, the burden of Ost35 transposition, which lacks the secondary site, would presumably negate any advantage accruing to Osmar14 as a result of its self restraint. ASO is less vulnerable than the secondary-site models because it relies on a competition between active multimers of the recombinase for their primary binding sites at the transposon ends. Although it can, in principle, be subverted by the resistance of low-affinity elements to OPI, this effect can only operate within limits (Figure 4B, note the slow amplification when the copy number is low). Although not completely immune, the ASO mechanism is robust to this type of selfish exploitation. ASO also provides a homeostatic mechanism in that a doubling of the transposase concentration always halves the rate of transposition per element, irrespective of the values of the kinetic constants governing the reaction. A larger genome will thus always receive a proportionately higher rate of transposition. In the case of mariner, the relative genetic burden is thus independent of the host genome size and is dictated by adaptive features of the transposon itself. These features include the transposase binding affinity, the strength of the promoter in a given host and the strength of the allosteric coupling between subunits. The latter is a powerful determinant able to change the rate of synapsis over many orders of magnitude. Indeed, allostery provides significant adaptive flexibility, which is unavailable in the S-PD reaction mechanism. Finally, by buffering the rate of transposition against changes in the transposase concentration, ASO may also provide a degree of protection from post-transcriptional silencing and heterochromatinization responses."

Firstly, that since the A and B sites are identical, they have identical binding kinetics. Secondly, that the two DNA-binding sites on a single transposase dimer have identical behavior and do not interact with each other, meaning that there are no allosteric interactions between the transposase subunits. In this idealized situation the first and second transposon end to be bound by the transposase, which ever this may be, are bound with equal affinity and the rate depends only on the relative concentration of the reactants. Later we will also consider a model in which allosteric interactions between the transposase subunits causes a kinetic barrier to recruitment of the second transposon end."

Of these, k0 and k1 are second order rate constants (units of M−1s−1) and the rest are first order rate constants (units of s−1). The experimental literature provides reasonable estimates for k−0/k0, k1 and k−1, given below, but not for k2, which we go on to calculate. k3 is also relatively unknown, which we discuss later."

The respective proteins will therefore have very similar three dimensional structures. A crystal structure for the Mos1 transposase revealed that it has an N-terminal DNA binding domain with two helix-turn-helix (H-T-H) motifs that are inserted into the major groove of the DNA close to the end of the transposon (Richardson et al., 2009). We can therefore expect that the dissociation constant for transposon end binding (Kd = k−1/k1) will be in the mid-picomolar concentration range. The lactose repressor (LacI) is one of the most thoroughly characterized H-T-H proteins, with many studies addressing the kinetic parameters of DNA binding. The LacI dimer is similar to a monomer of Hsmar1 transposase in that it binds to operator sequences by a pair of H-T-H motifs, which are located in adjacent major grooves. We therefore elected to use the kinetic parameters for LacI to model transposase binding to the transposon end. Estimated parameters for the behavior of the transposase are perhaps not ideal. However, our conclusions do not depend on the absolute values of the parameters because they have minimal effect beyond changing the scale on the axes of the graphs generated by the simulation. The relationships between the various parameters, which provide the key insights of the work, remain unchanged, as explained further below and in the main text."

However, it is now generally accepted that the Kd for LacI, and other dimeric H-T-H proteins, binding to their primary sites is in the mid to high picomolar concentration range. Many of the very low values quoted in the literature date from the late 1970s and early 1980s, and were determined at unphysiologically low salt concentrations. Another factor that complicates the lactose repressor literature is the complexity of the multiple binding sites encoded by the operator, which promote DNA looping and the mutual stabilization of dimers bound in cis to each other. Here we have used the kinetic parameters determined by Wells and Matthews and colleagues for LacI binding to a single site encoded on a 40 bp fragment of the lac operator under a physiological salt concentration (Table 3 of Hsieh et al. (1987))."

      "content": "In the course of our experiments with Hsmar1 transposase we have never recorded significant inhibition of the reaction by the moderate amounts of non-specific DNA used as a target in many of our experiments. This suggests that the affinity of the transposase for non-specific DNA is relatively low. We have therefore elected to adopt the equilibrium constant (Kd = k−0/k0) of LacI for non-specific DNA because it is probably fairly typical for trans-acting DNA binding proteins. We adopted the value provided by Von Hippel and colleagues because it was determined at a similar physiological salt concentration to the parameters noted above for site-specific binding (Revzin and Von Hippel, 1977). We used this equilibrium constant to assign arbitrary association and dissociation rate constants, k0 and k−0. It is difficult to define these rate constants precisely because DNA binding proteins have two distinct modes of non-specific interaction. Firstly, binding from the bulk solution is probably rapid with a rate equal to a sizable fraction of a diffusion-limited reaction. This is followed by a one-dimensional diffusion phase, during which the protein visits non-specific sites that are considered to be 1 bp apart. The equilibrium constant, Kd, is thus the product of one- and three-dimensional events, each of which has its own kon and koff components. Fortunately, the absolute values of k−0 and k0 are not important in the simulation because they serve only to define the equilibrium constant for non-specific sites, which in turn specifies the concentration of free transposase available for transposon end binding in a genome of a given size. The validity of this assumption was confirmed by running the simulation using several different pairs of values for k0 and k−0: the output was unchanged provided that k−0/k0 was always equal to the experimentally determined Kd (not shown)."

Both reactions involve the binding of transposase to DNA site B, so they are chemically identical. This might suggest that they would have the same reaction rates. However, in actuality, their reaction rates differ because the rate of diffusion for the free transposase is different from that of the DNA-bound transposase. Expressing their reaction rate constants as k1 for reaction 1 (as in the model diagram) and k1′ for reaction 2, the respective reaction rates are"

This model was recently shown to be reasonably accurate for modeling DNA dynamics (Petrov et al., 2006). The central model parameter is the filament persistence length, a, which is the characteristic length for filament bending. According to the model, DNA binding sites diffuse rapidly within their local regions, while also gradually diffusing away to more distant regions. The rate of this local ‘segmental diffusion’ is quantified with the diffusion coefficient Ds. Ds is the translational diffusion coefficient of a free DNA fragment with length a (Berg, 1984). Continuing with the above equations, R represents the distance over which a specific interaction occurs between transposase and its DNA binding sites. It arises from the assumption that the two reactants (the transposase binding domain and a DNA binding site, in this case) can be treated as hard spheres that react upon collision. Finally, Dp is the diffusion coefficient of free transposase relative to the center of mass of the DNA."

We then substituted kact into equation 4, along with a calculated value for k1,diff′ from equation 6, to estimate k1′. Finally, we used equations 7 and 8 to estimate k2, the rate of synapsis, from k1′.k1′ is only about a factor of 1.6 slower than k1. This indicates that the slower diffusion of DNA-bound transposase than of free transposase has only modest impact for in vitro experiments."

For the purposes of the simulation we assigned an association rate constant equal to that for the mariner transposase binding to a transposon end. In the respective prokaryotic and eukaryotic models, the rate of synapsis is therefore determined by the same association rate constant and the rate of diffusion, which is identical in both systems. The outputs of the respective simulations are therefore directly comparable and reveal differences in the underlying kinetic models."

We therefore computed the same numbers that are shown in Table 2, but for the in vivo situation, which are shown in Table 3. The only parameters sensitive to the high viscosity in vivo are the association rate constants, which includes the rate of synapsis. Our calculations show that the association rate constant, k1, suffers a modest twofold penalty in vivo (Table 3). This relieves OPI and increases the rate of transposition twofold (not shown). However, this is precisely offset by the penalty on non-specific binding, k0, which achieves the opposite. The results are very different for the rate of synapsis, which suffers an in vivo diffusion penalty of 2.8 × 104-fold (Tables 2 and 3). However, many DNA interactions are known to occur over much longer-ranges than those between transposon ends. It is therefore possible that other factors in vivo mitigate the severity of the diffusion penalty. For example, there is evidence that the factor jM is doubled by the chromatinization of DNA (Ringrose et al., 1999). The in vivo values in Table 3 should therefore be seen as initial estimates rather than an exhaustive treatment of the topic. Nevertheless, our calculated rate of synapsis is very close to the rates of lox/cre recombination measured in vivo with similarly separated recombination sites (Ringrose et al., 1999)."

However, in practice we consider synapsis to be essentially irreversible for the following reasons. Transposition reaction mixtures in which the catalytic Mg2+ ions are replaced by Ca2+ support transpososome assembly, but none of the chemical steps of the reaction. After the addition of the catalytic metal ion, the first nick at the transposon end is detected immediately (Claeys Bouuaert and Chalmers, 2010). This shows that nicking is very much faster than synapsis or synapsis unbinding. Synapsis in the presence of the catalytic metal ion is therefore essentially irreversible because of the loss of enthalpy associated with hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond. In principle, it is possible that there exists some form of unstable synaptic complex that matures into the stable form that immediately precedes the first chemical reaction. If such a complex existed it would be irrelevant to our experiments, in which the rate of synapsis is estimated from the rate of the first nick. When we consider the rate of synapsis we are therefore restricting ourselves to ‘productive synapses’, which yield the first nick. For the purposes of the simulation we have set the rate constant for synapsis unbinding (k−2) at 10−10 s−1. Synapsis in the model is therefore essentially irreversible."

This means that the actual value of k2 will be much lower than that calculated above for the idealized reaction, in which synapsis is the product of sequential, chemically identical, collisions between DNA binding domains and transposon ends. To account for the allosteric interactions between the transposase subunits we therefore require experimental estimates of k2 and k−1."

      "content": "Estimates for k−1 and k2 are provided by the kinetics of the in vitro reaction. In Figure 3C we see that about 50% of the transposon end present in SEC2 is released after 20 min incubation in the presence of cold competitor DNA. This corresponds to a dissociation rate constant of 5.8 × 10−4 s−1. We have previously shown that first strand nicking depends on, and is much faster than, synapsis (Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011 and ‘Discussion’ above). Consumption of the supercoiled substrate therefore provides an estimate of the rate of synapsis. Under optimal reaction conditions, with about one dimer of active transposase per transposon, only one half of the substrate is initially occupied by a single dimer and is therefore able to react. As explained above, the random association of transposase dimers and transposon ends at the start of the reaction means that a quarter would be occupied by two dimers and would suffer OPI and the other quarter would be completely unoccupied. The time required to consume one quarter of the substrate therefore approximates the half-time for synapsis. Since eukaryotic DNA has very little free supercoiling, the most relevant rate of synapsis is perhaps provided by an open circular substrate. In Figure 3D, the time taken to consume one quarter of the open circular substrate is about 2 hr, which corresponds to a pseudo-first order rate constant of 9.6 × 10−5 s−1. Note that the reason we are able to estimate the rate of synapsis is owing to the optimal reaction condition in vitro where k2 is largely independent of k0, k−0, k1 and k−1. This is because there is very little non-specific DNA present and the transposase concentration is such that most dimers are engaged in productive interactions with transposons."

With relaxed plasmid and short linear substrates, synapsis is the rate limiting step. Supercoiling in the substrate accelerates synapsis because the transposon ends have a high relative concentration in the plectosome and a favorable angular distribution. In an in vitro reaction, where the plasmid has more than twice its natural level of free supercoiling, the rate of synapsis is faster than cleavage of the second strand at the transposon end. Note that second strand cleavage at the second transposon end releases the transposon from the donor site (illustrated in Figure 2A). In a kinetic analysis of staged in vitro reactions with a supercoiled substrate, a small amount of excised transposon is observed at early time points [this is below the region of the gels shown in Figure 2B, but can be seen in Figure 5B of Claeys Bouuaert et al. (2011)]. The rate of integration must therefore be faster than the rate of second strand cleavage. The half life of the excised transposon is approximated by the time required to convert a quarter of the supercoiled substrate into product. From Figure 2B and other experiments this appears to be about 8 min which corresponds to a rate constant for integration of 1.4 × 10−3 s−1."

However, our reference in vitro simulation (Figure 3E) is relatively insensitive to the value of k3. This is because the extent to which the Hsmar1 specific factors, namely the slow dissociation rate of SEC2 and the slow recruitment of the second end, slow synapsis. Furthermore, once a steady-state rate is established the length of the maturation process does not matter because the rates of pathway entry and exit are equal. Thus, if k3 is reduced by three orders of magnitude to 1.4 × 10−6 s−1 (t1/2 = 5.7 days), the final rate of transposon amplification does not change significantly. However, it does take slightly longer to be achieved because of the time required for pathway entry and exit rates to balance (not shown). Note that we assume that every transposon that initiates catalysis goes on to complete excision and integration. This is supported by the in vitro reaction systems for Hsmar1 and Tn10 (Chalmers and Kleckner, 1994, 1996; Claeys Bouuaert and Chalmers, 2010; Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2011). The efficiency of the reaction in vivo is unlikely to be so high and this is dealt with in Figure 3G and the section of text entitled ‘The efficiency of transposition in vivo.’"

      "content": "Many transposons, and mariner in particular, have a wide host range. The promoters driving expression of transposase genes are therefore assumed to rely on general transcription factors. However, there is little published data pertaining to the possible strength of the promoters. Expression of the Hsmar1 promoter has been detected using a luciferase reporter system, but quantification is lacking for the contribution of a single copy of the element (Miskey et al., 2007). A recent proteomic study quantified the abundance of 5000 vertebrate proteins in mouse cells (Schwanhausser et al., 2011). The copy number per cell for most proteins ranged from about 100 to 1 million: The median was 16,000 and the mode was about 5000. In the simulation we set the transposase expression at 500 dimers per transposon. Although this is at the low end of the range for vertebrate proteins, it is not unusually low and allows for up to 1000 copies of the transposon before protein levels would reach the high end of the range. However, we note, once again, that our conclusions do not depend on the absolute values of the parameters because they have minimal effect beyond changing the scale on axes of the graphs generated by the simulation. The relationships between the various parameters, which provide the key insights of the work, remain unchanged."

As the authors point out, a solution to this problem is known for certain prokaryotic transposons, but the elucidated mechanism does not apply to eukaryotes (because it requires cis-acting transposase). In the case of eukaryotic transposons, there have been only sporadic proposed models, which have not been analyzed or assessed either experimentally or by quantitative modeling (which, in every case is dependent on information regarding the basic biochemistry of the transposition reaction)."

Furthermore, taken together, the presented observations provide very strong support for the validity of the model. The experimental observations are important and compelling, particularly the in vitro findings relating the responses to variations in transposase and transposon end concentrations, and the in vivo verification of several key predictions. No such study has ever been performed for any transposon, even in the prokaryotic cases, and the results presented here should be of broad interest to both the evolutionary biology community and the transposition mechanism community."

The site from which it was excised is repaired by homologous recombination using the other chromosome as a template, regenerating the transposon at the excision site, and the excised transposon goes on to integrate somewhere else.

The important point, which is implicit but should be stated explicitly, is that this feature does not in any way prevent the accumulation over time, which is the problem at hand here – it simply slows things down, regardless of whether that is in the current mechanism or the S-PD mechanism. That is, you still need the current mechanism (and the S-PD mechanism doesn’t work) if this feature is present."

The case of Tn5 is not relevant here because it involves a cis-acting transposase. But the case of mariner obviously is relevant. Here there are two points. First, the DEO model is fine, but the biochemistry presented in this paper for mariner suggests that it is not what is going on. This point should be made explicitly. Second, in principle, an element with a different biochemistry might use this mechanism; but, if so, the modeling suggests that there is a longer lag time before the effect kicks in. The authors are perhaps trying to be sure to be generous to the previous considerations. But they need to say (a) DEO can’t be true for mariner because the biochemistry says it isn’t and (b) it could potentially be true for some other element but with a disadvantage. Are there further candidate elements that might work in such a way?"

It is likely that this site was proposed to have the effect of repressing transposition. The important point, which is implicit but should be stated explicitly, is that this feature does not in any way prevent the accumulation over time, which is the problem at hand here – it simply slows things down, regardless of whether that is in the current mechanism or the S-PD mechanism. That is, you still need the current mechanism (and the S-PD mechanism doesn’t work) if this feature is present."

The case of Tn5 is not relevant here because it involves a cis-acting transposase. But the case of mariner obviously is relevant. Here there are two points. First, the DEO model is fine, but the biochemistry presented in this paper for mariner suggests that it is not what is going on. This point should be made explicitly. Second, in principle, an element with a different biochemistry might use this mechanism; but, if so, the modeling suggests that there is a longer lag time before the effect kicks in. The authors are perhaps trying to be sure to be generous to the previous considerations. But they need to say (a) DEO can’t be true for mariner because the biochemistry says it isn’t and (b) it could potentially be true for some other element but with a disadvantage. Are there further candidate elements that might work in such a way?"

This mechanism pops up again and again in protein regulation. See, for example Bray E, Lay S, PNAS 1997."
