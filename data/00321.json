      "content": "The hippocampal system appears to be critically important in establishing episodic memory of both internal and external events within contexts as well as spatial memory, which enables flexible spatial navigation. However, the neuronal substrates that function across different memories in the hippocampal system are poorly understood. I monitored large-scale activity patterns of hippocampal neuronal ensembles in rats performing a novel, continuous task that combined one visually guided and two memory-guided types of navigations in a constant environment. I found that the activity patterns of the hippocampal ensemble represent spatiotemporal contexts (journeys) constructed by temporally ordered past, present and expected future places in tandem with visually or mnemonically guided non-spatial contexts (task-demands) to form episodes. This finding therefore suggests that the hierarchical organization of contexts based on pattern separation and completion enables the hippocampus to play a dual role in spatial navigation and recall of episodic memory."

In the first memory task, the rats had to alternate their choices to obtain the reward, running through the maze from right-to-left and then from left-to-right (non-delayed spatial alternation). The second memory task worked the same way, except that the rats had to wait 5 s before turning left or right (delayed spatial alternation)."

As expected, he found that neurons tended to remap their place fields based on the animal's initial and final locations in the maze, regardless of which task the animal was performing. Surprisingly, however, neurons with specific place fields distinguished between the three tasks by firing at different rates in each."

Moreover, the prediction could be made even before the rat had completed the task. Overall, these results add to our understanding of how the hippocampus performs its dual roles in spatial navigation and episodic memory."

      "content": "There have been two frameworks suggested for the principal role of the hippocampus in memory: spatial memory and episodic memory (Scoville and Milner, 1957; O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978; Vargha-Khadem et al., 1997; Eichenbaum et al., 1999). During spatial behaviors, hippocampal pyramidal neurons discharge specifically at a certain location in the environment (the ‘place field'), suggesting that hippocampal neurons function in spatial memory (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; McNaughton and Morris, 1987; Muller et al., 1987). In contrast, episodic memory provides a record of past experiences in relation to a broad range of materials (Wood et al., 1999) and is structured by spatial, temporal, and non-spatial contexts (Tulving, 1983). Recent studies indicate that on the basis of the pattern separation and completion proposed by Marr (Marr, 1969), the place field of a given neuron changes (remapping) relative to three different contexts: spatial context characterized by environmental features (Bostock et al., 1991; Kentros et al., 1998), spatiotemporal context (journey) affected by the experienced origin and expected destination (Frank et al., 2000; Wood et al., 2000), and internally and externally guided non-spatial context (task-demand) (Gothard et al., 1996; Anderson and Jeffery, 2003; Smith and Mizumori, 2006). Moreover, during a temporal gap between events, the place cells encode successive moments or fire at a specific part of an episode (Pastalkova et al., 2008; MacDonald et al., 2011). These lines of evidence suggest that the hippocampal place code is not only closely related to the ‘where' of episodic memory but also to the ‘when and how'. To test whether the changes and dynamics of the hippocampal place code are the neuronal basis of spatial and episodic-like memory, it is necessary to conduct a multifaceted experiment in which many hippocampal neurons are simultaneously monitored during repeated exposures to either spatiotemporal or non-spatial contexts in a constant spatial environment."

      "content": "Rats were trained to navigate their way through a figure ‘8' maze in a continuous task that incorporated both visual discrimination and two types of memory-guided responses (see ‘Materials and methods', Figure 1). The task was divided into three subtasks: visual discrimination (VD), non-delayed spatial alternation (SA) and delayed spatial alternation (DA). In the VD subtask, a cue light on the left or right side was illuminated to indicate which direction to turn at a decision point (DP, Figure 1A) to receive a reward (medial forebrain bundle [MFB] electrical stimulation). In both the SA and DA subtasks, cue lights on both sides were illuminated and the rats had to alternate between left and right at the decision point (Figure 1B). The difference between the SA and DA subtasks was that in the DA subtask, a barrier appeared at the middle of the central stem for 5 s to interpose a delay period. During the delay period, the rats paused steadily in the forward direction in front of the barrier. Some lines of evidence suggest that the SA-type task is often affected by hippocampal lesions (O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978). By contrast, a recent study implied that the SA-type task is independent on the hippocampus (Ainge et al., 2007b). Unlike the visually cued VD and procedural memory-guided SA subtasks, the episodic-like memory-guided DA type of task is critically dependent on the hippocampus (Ainge et al., 2007b; Ferbinteanu et al., 2011). The rats continuously performed these subtasks at least twice in a task over the course of approximately 1 hr (Figure 1D). This task allowed for examinations of the influence of internal and external events on hippocampal neuronal activity and hippocampus-dependence both between and within different journeys and task-demands."

      "content": "The place codes could be changed in terms of firing rates (rate remapping) or both firing rates and location (global/complete remapping; Bostock et al., 1991; Leutgeb et al., 2005). For each place cell, I independently compared the firing location and rate of the place fields during task performance. The spatial similarity was measured by calculating the spatial correlation between a pair of maps. The rate similarity was measured as one minus the normalized difference between the firing rates. Thus, the spatial similarity measurement was independent of rate similarity. In an identical trial type (i.e., combination of journey and task-demand), the distributions of the measurements between first and second exposures (i.e., first vs second exposure in the right-to-left or left-to-right journey in the VD, SA or DA subtasks) were highly similar (median Spearman correlations [rs] > 0.67; median rate similarity indices [rr] > 0.80; Figures 3A, 4B,C), suggesting that, as in numerous previous studies on the hippocampal place code (O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971; McNaughton and Morris, 1987; Muller et al., 1987), the pyramidal cells are place-specific during identical visually or mnemonically guided behaviors in a constant environment. Within a given task-demand, the distributions of the spatial correlation and the change in firing rates in the place fields in the central stem between different journeys (i.e., a right-to-left vs left-to-right journey in the VD, SA, or DA subtasks) were significantly lower than those seen under control conditions (repeated exposures to identical trial types) (median rs < 0.45, Z < −22.04, p<0.001; median rr < 0.68, Z < −8.96, p<0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figures 3B and 4B,C), suggesting that place-specific activity is strongly dependent on the journey (Frank et al., 2000; Wood et al., 2000; Ferbinteanu and Shapiro, 2003; Bower et al., 2005; Ainge et al., 2007a). In contrast, in an identical journey, the distributions of the spatial correlations among the VD, SA and DA subtasks (i.e., VD vs SA subtask, VD vs DA subtask, SA vs DA subtask in the right-to-left or left-to-right journey) were similar or higher than under control conditions (median rs > 0.75, Z > 1.07, n.s. or p<0.001, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figures 3B and 4B); however, the distributions of the change in firing rates in the place fields were clearly lower (median rr < 0.80, Z < −2.79, p<0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test; Figures 3B and 4C), indicating that only the rate of a place-specific activity is modulated with a given task-demand (Smith and Mizumori, 2006). Taken together, the results suggest that irrespective of hippocampus-dependence (Morris and Frey, 1997; Ainge et al., 2007b; Ferbinteanu et al., 2011), the hippocampal pyramidal cells in the maze were not only activated by a specific location, but also by the experienced past and expected future places accompanied by the visually guided or memory-guided task-demands (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1)."

      "content": "The activity patterns relative to the place, journey and task-demand during tasks suggested that the dynamics of the ensemble activity pattern rather than just the firing pattern of single cells should be considered. The dynamics of neuronal ensemble activity as a trajectory through a state space were therefore analyzed (neuronal trajectory; see ‘Materials and methods'; Figure 5) (Briggman et al., 2005; Mazor and Laurent, 2005; Harvey et al., 2012). At each specific location, the activity state of the ensemble containing n simultaneously recorded neurons was defined as a point in an n-dimensional space, with each dimension representing the activity of a single neuron. In the trajectory of a journey within a given subtask, the neuronal ensemble activity tended to move in similar orbits that started and ended at similar positions. Moreover, the trajectories of different journeys exhibited unique orbits (Figure 6A,B). To quantify the trajectory specificity, I used a classifier based on the distance from an individual lap trajectory to the mean right-to-left/left-to-right trajectories at single locations. In each subtask, the neuronal trajectory, consisting of all of the simultaneously recorded place cells, was sufficient to separate the left-to-right journey from the right-to-left journey with high accuracy, and vice versa (Figure 6C; p<0.001, binomial test, chance = 0.5). Surprisingly, even in visually guided situations in which memory-guided decisions could not be utilized (i.e., left-to-left/right-to-right journey in the VD subtask), the accuracy was sufficiently better than chance levels before the rat behaviorally chose its next direction (prospective coding; Figure 6D; p<0.001, chance = 0.5; turn onset: Figure 1C). Furthermore, this trajectory could be used to predict all possible trial types (i.e., eight possibilities; VD1, VD2, VD3, VD4, SA1, SA2, DA1 and DA2) on single laps at better than chance levels even during periods of running through the central stem of the maze in which the head direction, speed and place factors were almost constant for each rat (Figure 7, p<0.001, binomial test, chance = 0.125; Table 1). Thus, the activity in the hippocampus could be considered to be divergent, episode-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal ensemble activity (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1)."

As expected from the place field properties, the same right-to-left/left-to-right journey produces a similar neuronal trajectory at the ensemble level. However, the trajectories are shifted between the task-demands in certain spaces (PC2 in this schematic), thereby generalizing a journey over task-demands. When the future direction changes from the expectation at the decision point, the trajectory shifts to the corresponding one (red dashed lines, VD2, VD4). The trajectory shift can be triggered not only by external events (the light-cues) but also by internal events (expected future direction) before the behavioral choices"

For all categories, the average output of the binary classifiers showed a high level of accuracy at the ensemble level (Figure 8, p <0.001, binomial test, chance = 0.5) and no significant differences among them (p >0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test with Turkey honestly significant difference [HSD] post-hoc test).

If this assumption is correct, knowing the neuronal trajectories for right-to-left and left-to-right journeys in one subtask should allow classification into right-to-left and left-to-right journeys in the other subtasks. To test this, the similarities between the ensemble activity patterns in the central stem of the maze were quantitatively analyzed using a distance-dependent classification scheme. As expected, based on the mean right-to-left/left-to-right trajectories in any one of three subtasks, the classifier outputs could predict the corresponding individual journeys within the other remaining two subtasks at a high level of accuracy at the ensemble level (see ‘Materials and methods'; Figure 9, p<0.001, binomial test, chance = 0.5, n = 128 cells).

If the actual journey was R-L, and d-to-RL was less than d-to-LR, the lap at that location was classified as a correct generalization, and vice versa.

      "content": "To summarize, although the same prominent environmental features were encountered in the same locations, the spatial representation of the hippocampal CA1 at various points in the maze were dissimilar in both firing location and rate among different journeys, irrespective of either visually or mnemonically guided demands, in a global remapping manner. The result supports the view that hippocampal pyramidal cells show journey-dependent coding during internally or externally guided goal-directed behaviors (Ferbinteanu et al., 2011). However, when the rats experienced changes in prominent, non-spatial features with internal and external events (i.e., subtask differences), the hippocampus only modulated the journey-dependent activity by primarily changing the intensity of the firing rates. The latter finding indicates that the extent to which the place fields remap is demand-specific (Smith and Mizumori, 2006) in a rate remapping manner. Neither the journey-dependent nor demand-specific coding was chiefly influenced by the running speed, head direction, or lateral position. In addition to the evidence from the place field measurements, even when the given task-demands were different, the classifier could sufficiently predict the journey from the ensemble activity patterns, suggesting that the journey representation is generalized and that non-spatial demand-specific representation is hierarchically ranked at a lower level. The neuronal trajectory of the ensemble activity differed enough to classify any trial type; prior to its behavioral choice, significant accuracy could be achieved even in a visually-guided situation in which memory-guided decision could not be made. The neuronal ensemble code for distinguishing trial types in the hippocampal ensemble activity was relatively equal to that for journeys and task-demands. Thus, the results imply that based not only on externally induced but also internally generated events, the hippocampus processes the combination of journey and task-demand as a single episode."

However, the relationship among them in the hippocampal neuronal ensemble codes was unclear in these studies because each piece of information was independently examined. I report that all of this information can be simultaneously preserved in the hippocampal output to form episodes. The information for journey and task-demand is not horizontally but hierarchically organized; expected future events in the hippocampus can trigger episode separation. From the viewpoint of context, journey and task-demand can be considered to be spatiotemporal and non-spatial contexts, respectively. Thus, the hierarchical organization of spatiotemporal and non-spatial contexts in the hippocampal episodic code, which is based on the context version of pattern separation and completion through the remapping of place fields, not only enables flexible spatial navigation but also contributes to the recall of episodic memory."

To prevent the rats from accessing unnecessary distal room cues, the task was performed under dim light. Initially, two barriers were put into the maze to construct an O-shaped track. After electrode implantation, the rats were trained to run along the left/right O-shaped track unidirectionally for reward signals (MFB stimulation) at a reward zone (Figure 1A, RZ). Once the rats were running smoothly along both left and right O-shaped tracks (∼3 to 7 days), all of them were trained to run in the VD subtask for a reward in the figure 8-shaped maze. In the VD subtask, one of the two visual cues (LED-lights at the right and left corners; Figure 1A) was illuminated randomly; the visual cue at the decision point of the maze (Figure 1A, DP) indicated which direction to turn to receive reward signals. The rats did not access the visual cue until reaching the decision point (Figure 1A) because the height of the walls of the maze (20 cm) was much higher than the level of the rat's eyes (∼5 cm) and the rats did not stand up during the experiment. The rats were trained for ∼3 to 7 days until they achieved a threshold of 80% decisions correct for >20 laps at a constant running speed (>20 cm/s). Next, they were trained to run in the SA subtask for >20 laps. In the SA subtask, both LEDs were illuminated so that the rats could not rely on the visual cue. Instead, the rat had to choose a direction opposite to the previous one. Those alternating behaviors spontaneously occurred and the rats easily achieved the threshold of 80% decisions correct for >20 laps (∼1 to 3 days). Finally, the rats were trained to run in the DA subtask for 20 laps. The DA subtask was almost identical to the SA subtask, except that a 5-s delay period was incorporated. During the delay period, a barrier appeared for 5 s, 20 cm ahead of the entrance to the central stem (Figure 1A, blue line). Because the rats initially tended to move back from the barrier during the first few laps of the DA subtask, two other barriers were set at both sides of the return rail to prevent such behavior until it ceased. The rats achieved a threshold of 90% decisions correct for >20 laps (1 day)."

The unit-recordings were made within 2–6 training days after each rat conducted this final sequence of subtasks. The number of possible journeys in the VD subtask was twice that of the other subtasks. Thus, to increase the sample size for the VD subtask for analysis, and to clearly distinguish the behaviorally similar SA and DA subtasks, 10 laps of the VD subtask were interpolated between the SA and DA subtasks. The rats achieved a 95% correct decision rating from the beginning of the continuous task."

ICSort completed two steps: clustering and separation. Initially, in the clustering step, ICSort automatically sorted the first, second and third principal components' feature vectors of all the extracted spikes in the high-dimensional clustering space using KlustaKwik. Then, the extracted spike waveforms in each sorted cluster were concatenated. Next, in the separation step, ICSort used FastICA to find spatial filters to separate the spike waveforms into spatially fixed and distinct, maximally independent components (ICs). To determine which ICs were indicative of neuronal activity, spikes of >50 μV were extracted from each IC and checked to determine whether there was a clear refractory period in the inter-spike interval (ISI) histogram. Finally, the ICSort aggregated these distributed ICs into single units based on each ICA basis vector, which represents the relative distance between the source of the IC and the tip of the electrode. This approach has been previously described in detail (Takahashi et al., 2003a, 2003b; Takahashi and Sakurai, 2007, 2009a, 2009b)."

Initially, the path of the rat was linearlized for each journey by projecting the actual trajectory followed by the rat on that lap onto a user-defined idealized path using nearest neighbor Delaunay triangulation. Spatial bins had a resolution of approximately 0.35 cm. At each location on the linearized path, the spike count that convolved with the Gaussian (SD = 5 cm) of the ensemble containing n simultaneously monitored cells was defined as a point in an n-dimensional space, with each dimension representing the activity of a single neuron. Since the neuronal trajectory is in n-dimensional space, to visualize the neuronal trajectory in three-dimensional space, principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a dimension-reduction technique. The data were organized into m locations by an n-cell data set."

The classification was performed for individual laps based on the distances to the mean lap trajectories. If the distance to the mean target trajectory was less than the distance to the other mean trajectories, the location for that lap was classified as the targeted choice. Classification accuracy was calculated at each location by averaging across laps for the individual trial types. In all of the distance classifications, the mean trajectories were calculated excluding the test trajectory (i.e., leave-one-out cross validation). In Figure 8, the classification accuracy was measured for each rat based on the most frequently classified choices at the central stem of the maze. The target cells were all simultaneously monitored place cells in each rat. In Figure 9, the classification accuracy for generalization was calculated based on the most frequently classified choices at the central stem of the maze; the combination of target cells for the classification were randomly chosen 1000 times. For control conditions, shuffling was performed by randomizing the sequence of laps 1000 times."

However, the exact point where the rats mentally detect the visual cue cannot be estimated because measuring the awareness of the visual cue for rats is difficult to perform. Instead, the timing of the behavioral output was estimated based on the location of turn onset. The turn onset was defined as the last location when the rat was in the central stem or the upper junction of the maze (i.e., DP in Figure 1A) and when the angular velocity was below a threshold value (0.12 rev/s) (Harvey et al., 2012) (Figure 1C). These locations of turn onset were considered the signature of the rats' behavioral decision in the analyses."
