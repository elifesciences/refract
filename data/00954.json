Now, more than 160 years later, Hern√°n Burbano of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology and co-workers have combined the power of next-generation sequencing technology with the availability of herbarium samples to peek through a 50-year window of history at the genome of the pathogen that contributed to so much human suffering (Yoshida et al., 2013)."

However, this idea was challenged when researchers at North Carolina State University identified a different type of mitochondrial DNA in herbarium samples of potato late blight collected between 1845 and 1886 (Ristaino et al., 2001)."

They found that the pathogen strains in all samples were representatives of a single lineage, which they have called HERB-1. This strain of P. infestans was responsible for the first global migration of the pathogen in the 1840s, and then persisted for at least 50 years. It has not been observed in modern times, but is clearly a close relative of US-1. Analysis of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA showed HERB-1 and US-1 to be sister groups in a clade distinct from contemporary genotypes."

The new work also emphasises the threats associated with the movement of pathogens between continents, and highlights the occurrence of waves of pathogen migration and genotype displacement. Indeed, dramatic shifts in P. infestans populations are still being observed today with, for example, the aggressive genotype 13_A2 displacing other genotypes across Europe over a period of less than three years (Cooke et al., 2012), and the rapid emergence of genotype US-22 in the eastern USA in 2009 (Fry et al., 2013). Moreover, it should be possible to use the newly obtained DNA sequences to develop markers that allow 20th century samples to be tested for the presence of HERB-1. It will be interesting to figure out what happened between 1900 and the 1970s, when new populations began to displace US-1 in Europe (Figure 1)."

      "content": "Schematic representation of the time-line for the emergence of major lineages of Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen that causes late blight in potatoes, as proposed by Burbano and co-workers (Yoshida et al., 2013). P. infestans and P. mirabilis (a pathogen that does not infect potatoes) are thought to have diverged from a common ancestor about 1200 years ago. Since then there have been at least three major migrations of P. infestans from a sexually reproducing population in Mexico (shown by black triangles). The first involves a metapopulation established in an unknown region, from which HERB-1 and US-1 emerged and spread around the world. US-1 is rarely found in contemporary populations (as indicated by the dotted black line) and HERB-1 is not found anywhere today (red cross). A shipment of potatoes from Mexico into Europe during a drought in 1976 is thought to be the source of the population of P. infestans that displaced US-1 in Europe and resulted in the emergence of aggressive new clones such as 13_A2 (also known as Blue13). Lastly, independent migrations into the US resulted in the dominance of the US-8 lineage, although this is now being displaced by other lineages such as US-22. The precise timing of the displacement of HERB-1 by US-1 remains undefined."

Yoshida et al. found no evidence for the positive selection of particular genes that might have driven displacement of HERB-1 by US-1. They hypothesised that cross breeding commercial potatoes with Solanum demissum, a wild species of potato that is resistant to some lineages of P. infestans, in Europe in the 1930s-1950s may have driven selection against HERB-1 and, by inference, favoured the US-1 strain that displaced it. This is an interesting theory, and there is a clear example of a widely grown commercial cultivar (the Pentland Dell) that contained resistance genes from S. demissum that were subsequently ‚Äòbroken‚Äô by a changing pathogen population (Malcolmson, 1969; Fry, 2008). However, more data are needed to test this hypothesis."

Should we expect to see a difference in the response of the different lineages of P. infestans to this form of resistance? Understanding the co-evolution of hundreds of virulence genes in the pathogen (Haas et al., 2009) with potentially similar numbers of resistance genes in potato (Jupe et al., 2012) is challenging, and datasets such as this should help to answer this question."

The long-term evolutionary consequences of such clonality are that deleterious mutations can accumulate. The decline in fitness caused by these mutations is an example of Muller‚Äôs ratchet in action (Goodwin, 1997) and might explain why lineages emerging from the sexually reproducing metapopulation described by Yoshida et al. displaced HERB-1. Yoshida et al. provide further support for such a scenario by showing that HERB-1 was diploid but US-1 and contemporary clonal lineages often have increased ploidy. It could be that such increased genetic diversity, providing a buffering capacity against deleterious mutations, offered subsequent lineages an evolutionary advantage over HERB-1."

By providing significant insights into the make-up of one of the most notorious emerging diseases in history, the work of Burbano, Yoshida, Schuenemann and colleagues offers us a valuable opportunity to learn from the past."
