      "content": "The general transcription factor TFIID comprises the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and approximately 14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Here we find, unexpectedly, that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) contain only six TAFs (TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11), whereas following differentiation all TAFs are expressed. Directed and global chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses reveal an unprecedented promoter occupancy pattern: most active genes are bound by only TAFs 3 and 5 along with TBP, whereas the remaining active genes are bound by TBP and all six hESC TAFs. Consistent with these results, hESCs contain a previously undescribed complex comprising TAFs 2, 6, 7, 11 and TBP. Altering the composition of hESC TAFs, either by depleting TAFs that are present or ectopically expressing TAFs that are absent, results in misregulated expression of pluripotency genes and induction of differentiation. Thus, the selective expression and use of TAFs underlies the ability of hESCs to self-renew."

Different genes code for the various proteins associated with these two properties, and understanding the behaviour and properties of stem cells in detail is a major challenge in developmental biology. In human embryonic stem cells that have not yet differentiated, the genes that code for the transcription factors involved in the self-renewal process are expressed, whereas the genes associated with differentiation are not active. However, if the expression of the genes for self-renewal is reduced, the process of differentiation will begin, and the embryonic stem cells will be able to produce any one of the 200 or so different types of cell found in the human body."

Transcription is the first step in the process by which genes are expressed as proteins, and it cannot start until the relevant transcription factor binds to a stretch of DNA near the gene called the promoter. These transcription factors are complex structures that contain a central protein called TBP, which binds to the promoter, and 14 or so other proteins called TAFs."

In particular, they found that undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells contain only 6 of the 14 TAFs observed in other cells, although all 14 are present after differentiation. Moreover, for many active genes the transcription factors contained only two of these TAFs. There was also evidence for a new complex that contained the other four TAFs plus TBP."

The factors involved in the accurate transcription of eukaryotic structural genes by RNA polymerase II can be classified into two groups. First, general (or basic) transcription factors (GTFs) are necessary and can be sufficient for accurate transcription initiation in vitro (for review, see Thomas and Chiang, 2006). These basic factors include RNA polymerase II itself and at least six GTFs: TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF and TFIIH. The GTFs assemble on the core promoter in an ordered fashion to form a pre-initiation complex (PIC)."

In general, activators are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins whose recognition sites are typically present upstream of the core promoter. Activators work in large part by increasing PIC formation but can also act through other mechanisms, such as accelerating the rate of transcriptional elongation, promoting multiple rounds of transcription and directing chromatin modifications (reviewed in Green, 2005; Fuda et al., 2009; Weake and Workman, 2010)."

However, it is now clear that the differential expression and use of basic transcription factors can also contribute to eukaryotic gene regulation (reviewed in Davidson, 2003; Hochheimer and Tjian, 2003). This notion is most dramatically illustrated by a variety of studies focused on the GTF TFIID, a multi-subunit complex composed of the TATA-box-binding protein (TBP) and a set of ∼14 TBP-associated factors (TAFs)."

Subsequently, similar classes of TAF-dependent and -independent genes were identified in mammalian cells (Raha et al., 2005; Tokusumi et al., 2007). Consistent with the existence of TAF-independent promoters, more recent studies have found that TAFs are depleted upon terminal differentiation of muscle (Deato and Tjian, 2007; Deato et al., 2008) and liver (D'Alessio et al., 2011). TFIID diversity is also promoted by tissue-specific variants of TAFs as well as TBP derivatives referred to as TBP-related factors (reviewed in D'Alessio et al., 2009; Müller et al., 2010)."

Two characteristic properties of hESCs, pluripotency, a capacity to differentiate into all fetal and adult cell lineages, and the ability to undergo symmetrical self-renewing divisions, are largely controlled at the transcriptional level (reviewed in Chen and Daley, 2008). In undifferentiated hESCs, pluripotency genes such as OCT4 (also called POU5F1), NANOG and SOX2 are expressed, whereas genes involved in differentiation are transcriptionally inactive (reviewed in Sun et al., 2006; Pan and Thomson, 2007). Decreased expression of pluripotency genes induces differentiation (Niwa et al., 2000), and thus proper transcriptional regulation is essential for self-renewal of undifferentiated hESCs."

To investigate this possibility, we analyzed expression of 13 TAFs by immunoblotting lysates from H9 cells, a well-characterized hESC line. As a control, we also analyzed TAF expression in HeLa cells, which have been extensively used to study TFIID composition and function. The immunoblot of Figure 1A shows, as expected, that all 13 TAFs were expressed in HeLa cells. By contrast, hESCs clearly expressed TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 11, whereas expression of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 was undetectable. Interestingly, TAF6 is expressed in both cell types, but the isoform present in H9 cells is predominantly the short delta form, whereas in HeLa cells, the major TAF6 isoform is the larger, alpha/beta form. The specificity of each TAF antibody was confirmed by RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2). We observed a similar TAF expression pattern in a second hESC line, H1 cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis comparing TAF mRNA levels in HeLa and H9 cells correlated with the immunoblotting results (Figure 1B). Unlike the TAFs, all other GTFs analyzed were comparably expressed in HeLa and H9 cells (Figure 1C). Based upon these results we conclude that only six of the canonical TFIID TAFs are present in hESCs."

To investigate this issue, we performed a series of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. In the first set of experiments we selected 10 transcriptionally active genes and performed ChIP analysis to monitor promoter occupancy by the six hESC TAFs. As a normalization standard, we also monitored occupancy of TBP and RNA polymerase II large subunit (POL2) on these 10 promoters. As expected, we found that TBP and POL2 were present at comparable levels at each of the 10 promoters (Figure 3A). However, the absolute level of TBP and POL2 bound to each promoter significantly varied among the 10 genes. Therefore, in this experiment and those presented below, TAF recruitment was normalized to the level of TBP occupancy. The ChIP results of Figure 3B revealed two groups of genes with distinct TAF promoter occupancy patterns. The first group, which we refer to as class I genes, were bound by TAFs 3 and 5 but not by TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11, whereas the second group, class II genes, were bound by all six hESC TAFs."

The ChIP analysis of Figure 4B shows that TAFs 1, 8 and 9 were readily detected on the promoters of genes in HeLa cells but, as expected, not H9 cells. Next, we analyzed the six TAFs that are expressed in both HeLa and hESCs. Figure 4C shows that in both cell types TAFs 3 and 5 were recruited to the promoters of the seven genes. By contrast we found that TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11 were bound to the promoters of the seven genes in HeLa but not in H9 cells (Figure 4C).

The qRT-PCR results of Figure 5A show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAFs 3 and 5 in H9 cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) greatly reduced expression of both class I and II genes. By contrast, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TAFs 2, 6, 7 and 11 decreased expression of class II, but did not affect expression of class I genes (Figure 5B). Comparable results were obtained with a second, unrelated siRNA directed against each of the six TAFs (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Collectively, these results establish a strong relationship between TAF occupancy and transcriptional activity in hESCs."

The overall results are summarized in Figure 6. We first defined a group of ∼3600 high-confidence actively transcribed genes based upon co-occupancy of both TBP and POL2 at the transcription start-site (Figure 6—figure supplements 1–3). The vast majority of active genes had promoter-bound TAF3 and TAF5 (Figure 6A). Significantly, a smaller fraction of active genes had promoter-bound TAF7 or TAF11, and there was substantial overlap between TAF7- and TAF11-bound genes (Figure 6B). As expected, the vast majority of genes bound by TAFs 7 and 11 were also bound by TAFs 3 and 5 (Figure 6C). Representative examples of promoter occupancy maps for two class I (SLC25A3, CCNB2) and class II (SFPQ, UCHL1) genes are shown in Figure 6D."

Second, the fraction of genes with alternative promoters (identified based upon UCSC Genome Browser annotations; see ‘Materials and methods’) was significantly higher for class II than for class I genes (Figure 6F).

Figure 8A shows that shRNA-mediated knockdown of each of the six hESC TAFs (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) induced differentiation, as evidenced by a decreased percentage of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies. To confirm this conclusion, we also tested whether knocking down hESC TAFs would induce differentiation by analyzing expression of a diverse set of differentiation markers: AFP (endoderm), CGB7 (trophoectoderm), IGF2 (mesoderm), NES (ectoderm) and SOX1 (neuroectoderm). Figure 8B shows that depletion of each hESC TAF resulted in up-regulation, to varying extents, of these differentiation markers. Comparable results were obtained with a second, unrelated shRNA or siRNA directed against each of the six TAFs (Figure 8—figure supplements 2 and 3). Finally, the induction of differentiation following knockdown of hESC TAFs was also evidenced by decreased expression of the pluripotency genes NANOG (Figure 8C and Figure 8—figure supplement 4) and OCT4 (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Thus, the hESC TAFs are required to maintain the undifferentiated state."

We found that ectopic expression of TAF1 (Figure 8D) resulted in differentiation, as evidenced by a decreased number of alkaline phosphatase-positive colonies (Figure 8E), the induction of differentiation markers (Figure 8F, left), and decreased expression of NANOG (Figure 8F, right). Interestingly, Figure 8G shows that ectopic TAF1 expression decreased expression of several class II genes, including as expected OCT4, whereas expression of class I genes was either unaffected or in some instances increased modestly. Ectopic expression of several other TAFs not present in hESCs also resulted in loss of expression of OCT4, a class II gene, but not ACTB, a class I gene (Figure 8H). By contrast, ectopic expression of TBP or TAFs that are present in hESCs did not affect OCT4 levels. To investigate the basis for the decreased OCT4 expression, we performed ChIP analysis. Figure 8I shows that, following ectopic expression of TAF1, TBP and POL2 were no longer recruited to the OCT4 promoter. Collectively, the results of Figure 8 show that altering the composition of hESC TAFs results in misregulation of gene expression and induction of differentiation."

The absence of TAFs was confirmed by multiple, independent experimental approaches including immunoblotting (Figure 1A and Figure 1—figure supplement 3), qRT-PCR (Figure 1B) and ChIP (Figure 4B). Previous studies have reported tissue-specific TAF variants and alterations in TAF expression (reviewed in D'Alessio et al., 2009; Müller et al., 2010), but the composition of hESC TAFs is unprecedented and is likely highly specific, if not unique, to hESCs. For example, we find that mouse ESCs, which bear both similarities and differences to hESCs (Ginis et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2005; Schnerch et al., 2010), express all TFIID TAFs analyzed (Figure 9), consistent with the results of a recent study that focused on the role of TAF3 in mouse ESCs (Liu et al., 2011)."

Notably, all but one of our experiments were performed in another hESC line, H9 cells. In the one experiment performed in H1 cells, we compared TAF levels in H1 and H9 cells by immunoblotting (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). The pattern of TAF expression in H1 and H9 cells was qualitatively similar but the experiment could not rule out the possibility that TAF1 was present at low levels in H1 cells, which could explain the ENCODE ChIP-Seq results."

However, if H9 cells do contain low levels of TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 our biochemical experiments indicate that they are below that required to stably associate with TBP and the TAFs that are detectably present in H9 cells to form the much larger TFIID complex (Figure 2A). In addition, we could not detect significant binding of TAFs 1, 8 and 9 on the promoters of seven transcriptionally active genes in H9 cells in a ChIP assay, although binding was readily detected on the same promoters in HeLa cells (Figure 4B). Thus, our conclusion that H9 cells contain no (or very low levels of) TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13 is based not only on expression data but also on biochemical results and promoter binding experiments."

Notably, this novel TBP-containing complex lacks TAF1, which in the canonical TFIID complex interacts directly with TBP (Chen et al., 1994), and TAF4, which is essential for assembly of Drosophila TFIID (Wright et al., 2006).

These nine TAFs can form five specific heterodimers: TAF3–10, TAF6–9, TAF4–12, TAF8–10 and TAF11–13. Several of these heterodimers are thought to be important for the assembly and structure of TFIID. hESCs contain only three HFD-containing TAFs (3, 6 and 11), which cannot form any of the five known heterodimers. This observation strongly suggests there are major differences in assembly and structure of TFIID and the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex."

In this regard, TAF2 and TAF6 have been shown to interact with promoter sequence elements (reviewed in Maston et al., 2006), which may contribute to differential promoter recognition by the TBP/TAF 2,6,7,11 complex. In addition, TAF3 contains a PHD finger domain that can bind to the H3K4me3 chromatin mark (Vermeulen et al., 2007), which is enriched at class I promoters (Figure 6E)."

There was, however, a statistically significant increase in alternative promoters at class II genes (Figure 6F). Notably, alternative promoter use has been suggested to play a role in generating tissue-specific transcripts (Kimura et al., 2006; Kolle et al., 2011; Pal et al., 2011)."

The core promoter sequence is identical in every cell, raising the possibility that in hESCs differences in activators or epigenetic signatures may be coordinated with the alterations in core promoter complexes. For example, in the myogenic program, core promoter recognition complex changes correlates with the presence of developmentally regulated activators (Deato et al., 2008)."

Thus, the unusual composition of TAFs described here is required for the ability of hESCs to properly regulate gene expression, maintain an undifferentiated state, and self-renew. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the TAFs that are absent from undifferentiated hESCs are expressed following differentiation (Figure 1D). The transcriptional induction of several differentiation markers, which are not normally expressed in hESCs, following knockdown of an hESC TAF can be explained either by the dispensability of the TAF for transcription of the marker, or incomplete knockdown enabling transcription to occur at reduced TAF levels."

These and other findings have prompted speculation that during differentiation the canonical TFIID complex becomes progressively specialized (reviewed in D'Alessio et al., 2009). However our results reveal a more complex model. Rather than starting from a complete, canonical TFIID and progressing to more restricted forms, undifferentiated hESCs start with a specialized, highly unique general transcription machinery, then switch to a period of complete TFIID before specialization of the transcription machinery again in some terminal differentiation programs. Collectively, these findings suggest that altering the composition of the basic transcription machinery in general and TAFs specifically may be a particularly powerful mechanism for developmental reprogramming."

For Figure 1D, H9 cells were passaged using Accutase (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) and plated without feeders in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1 µM all-trans retinoic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For transfections, H9 cells were grown in mTesR1 media (STEMCELL Technologies) under feeder-free conditions on plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS at 37°C and 5% CO2. The mouse ESC line PGK12.1, provided by N. Brockdorff, was cultured as previously described (Penny et al., 1996)."

Linker-adapted DNA was amplified for 18 rounds using high-fidelity Pfu polymerase, then purified. DNA was labeled with either Cy5-dCTP (chip samples) or Cy3-dCTP (no antibody control) in a second PCR amplification of 18 rounds. The labeled DNAs were purified on QIAquick columns (Qiagen) and the incorporation was checked by spectrophotometry. 20 pmol of each labeled DNA (chip and control) was combined and used to hybridize to a Human ChIP-chip 3 × 720K RefSeq Promoter Array (Roche NimbleGen, Madison, WI) using a hybridization kit, sample tracking controls, wash buffer kit and array processing accessories from NimbleGen. Arrays were scanned on an Agilent Scanner at 5 µm resolution. Data were analyzed to identify peaks of binding using Nimblescan software (Roche NimbleGen) with default settings. Further analysis of ChIP data was conducted using ChipPeakAnno (Zhu et al., 2010). The list of sites were filtered to remove multiple peaks occurring in the same promoter, which resulted in a set of genes whose promoters are bound by each factor. The data discussed in this publication have been deposited in NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO Series accession number GSE39312 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE39312).

The conventional/canonical TFIID complex comprises TBP and about 14 TAF subunits. In this work, it was found that TAFs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 11 - but not TAFs 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12, and 13 - are expressed in hESCs, and that TAFs 2, 6, 7, and 11 appear to form a novel complex with TBP. By ChIP analysis, two classes of transcriptionally active genes were identified in hESCs. Class I genes are regulated by TAFs 3 and 5, whereas Class II genes are regulated by all six TAFs in hESCs. RNAi depletion of TAF 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, or 11 as well as overexpression of TAF1 caused a decrease in pluripotency. These findings suggest that the proper regulation of TAFs is important for the maintenance of hESCs."

This work will be appropriate for publication in eLife if the following points are suitably addressed."

      "content": "With regard to RNA polymerase II recruitment, a number of previous studies by our laboratory and others have analyzed the relationship between TAF dependence and RNA polymerase II occupancy in vivo. Notably, these studies have been carried out in a wide range of eukaryotes including yeast, Drosophila S2 cells and mammalian cells. The results of these studies have clearly demonstrated that when a TAF is required for transcription of a gene, loss-of-function of that TAF (resulting from mutational inactivation, RNA interference-mediated depletion or decreased expression) results in diminished transcription that is accompanied by decreased RNA polymerase II occupancy in a chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Representative examples of such studies include those performed in yeast (Shen et al. 2003, EMBO J. 22:3395; Sharma et al. 2003, Genes Dev. 17:502), Drosophila S2 cells (Vorobyeva et al. 2009, PNAS 106:11049) and mammalian cells (Deato and Tjian 2007, Genes Dev. 21:2137; Zaborowska et al. 2012, Transcription 3:92). In addition to these in vivo examples, several in vitro studies have also demonstrated a role for TAFs in RNA polymerase II recruitment (see, for examples, Wu and Chiang 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:34235; Felinski and Quinn 2001, PNAS 98:13078)."

We believe that when these results are completed they may provide insights into the roles of specific TAFs in transcription of class I and class II genes and shed light on the differences between class I and class II promoters. However, our preliminary results indicate that the requirement of specific TAFs for recruitment of other TAFs and TBP is complex, differs among the TAFs, and may also differ between promoters of the same class. Therefore, until we have performed a comprehensive analysis, which will require considerably more experimentation and time and may necessitate genome-wide studies, we think it would premature to publish a limited set of results, which could be potentially non-representative and misleading."
