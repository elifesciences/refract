Increases may indicate neural recruitment, while decreases may imply that a region became unimportant or developed a more efficient representation of the skill. These overlapping mechanisms make interpreting learning-related changes of spatially averaged activity difficult. Here we show that motor-skill acquisition is associated with the emergence of highly distinguishable activity patterns for trained movement sequences, in the absence of average activity increases. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants produced either four trained or four untrained finger sequences. Using multivariate pattern analysis, both untrained and trained sequences could be discriminated in primary and secondary motor areas. However, trained sequences were classified more reliably, especially in the supplementary motor area. Our results indicate skill learning leads to the development of specialized neuronal circuits, which allow the execution of fast and accurate sequential movements without average increases in brain activity."

      "content": "The human brain has a remarkable ability to learn complex motor skills. However, the neural changes that underlie this ability remain largely unknown. Although functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that learning can lead to both activity increases and decreases in primary and secondary motor areas (for reviews, see Dayan and Cohen, 2011; Penhune and Steele, 2012; Hardwick et al., 2013), these average activity changes remain hard to interpret. On the one hand, motor skill acquisition may lead to increased neural recruitment for trained behaviors, thereby increasing average activation (Grafton et al., 1995; Karni et al., 1995; Hazeltine et al., 1997; Floyer-Lea and Matthews, 2005; Lehericy et al., 2005; Penhune and Doyon, 2002; Penhune and Doyon, 2005). Alternatively, learning may result in the development of representations that produce the same behavior with higher neural efficiency, thereby reducing activity (Jenkins et al., 1994; Toni et al., 1998; Ungerleider et al., 2002; Poldrack et al., 2005; Xiong et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2010; Penhune and Doyon, 2005). Finally, motor practice may induce simultaneous signal increases (due to increased neural recruitment) and signal decreases (due to more efficient encoding), making motor learning difficult to detect using traditional fMRI paradigms (Steele and Penhune, 2010)."

Consider the neural activation patterns for two different finger sequences in areas with different types of movement representations (Figure 1A–C). A region that controls elementary hand movements independent of their sequential context may comprise five separate neuronal populations (Figure 1A), each of which a dynamical system (Churchland et al., 2012), whose activation causes the production of an individual finger press. Because each sequence contains each finger once, the two sequences will activate the same cortical patches, albeit in a different temporal order. Due to the low temporal resolution of fMRI, in particularly when averaging, as done here, over three executions of the same sequence, the two sequences would be therefore associated with identical activity patterns."

The development of such neuronal populations with training is thought to underlie the faster production of trained sequences (Matsuzaka et al., 2007). Importantly, the existence of such units would cause the two sequences to rely on partly separate neuronal populations, that is they should be associated with slightly different activity patterns (Figure 1B). After prolonged training, some neurons even appear to code for longer fragments, firing preferentially at the beginning of specific sequences (Tanji and Shima, 1994). Areas containing many of such units would therefore activate even more distinct neuronal populations for particular trained sequences (Figure 1C). This idea therefore predicts that trained sequence should be associated with the activation of more distinct neuronal populations than comparable untrained sequences."

We tested this idea using ‘multi-voxel pattern analysis’ (MVPA), which detects differences in voxel-by-voxel activity patterns in an area of cortex, even if these patterns are highly overlapping and defined by neuronal differences on a small spatial scale (Kamitani and Tong, 2005; Swisher et al., 2010; Freeman et al., 2011). Participants were trained for 4 days to produce four different movement sequences with their left hand. After training, participants underwent two fMRI scans, performing either four trained or four untrained sequences. Using MVPA, we tested whether activity patterns of trained sequences could be discriminated from each other more easily than could untrained sequences, and how the representational structure changes with learning."

The results show that one aspect of the acquired skill was sequence-specific: the left-hand MTs were 237 ms (SE: ±42 ms) faster for trained than for untrained sequences. This difference was highly significant, also when correcting for small difference between the sequences at pre-test, t(14) = 5.749, p<0.0001. MTs for the untrained sequences dropped by 796 ms (±97 ms) compared to pre-test, t(15) = 8.23, p<0.001, suggesting that a considerable part of the acquired skill was general. For example, participants may have become faster at movement transitions between specific finger pairs. This ability would also enhance the production of untrained sequences, which shared 59.6% of digit transitions with the trained sequences. Therefore, the comparison of neural representations of trained and untrained sequences after learning will reveal correlates of the sequence-specific rather than general skill acquired during learning."

During one session participants performed the four trained sequences, and during the other four untrained sequences, in both cases with their left hand. The order of scans was counterbalanced between participants. Within each imaging run, the sequences were executed in pseudo-random order, with each trial lasting 13.5 s (Figure 1D). This design allowed us to measure repeatedly the activity pattern for each individual sequence. Using traditional univariate analysis, we first determined the regions that showed sequence-related activation increases compared to rest, average over the four sequences. As expected, we found significant activation (Figure 3A) in contralateral primary motor (M1) and sensory cortices (S1). Additional bilateral activation was found in secondary motor areas, including dorsal and ventral premotor cortex (PMd, PMv), supplementary motor areas (SMA/pre-SMA), in regions on the medial bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and in the occipital-parietal junction (OPJ) (Culham and Valyear, 2006). All activations were highly significant after correction for multiple tests. The pronounced ipsilateral activation during non-dominant hand movements is consistent with the suggested special role of the left hemisphere in complex movements (Verstynen et al., 2005)."

We tested this idea using a surface-based searchlight (see ‘Materials and methods’) in which we sequentially selected small areas of neocortex (circular regions of ∼10 mm diameter) and examined classification accuracy in each. A linear classifier determined whether the spatial fMRI activation patterns in each area reliably differed between the four trained sequences—and between the four untrained sequences. We then assigned the cross-validated classification accuracy to the center of the region, thereby building a map of sequence representation across the whole cortical surface."

One may argue that a region that contains neuronal populations that encode single finger movements (Figure 1A) may have been activated with slightly different time-courses for the different sequences, which may have been picked up by the classifier. This explanation, however, is unlikely for two reasons: first, the spatial distribution of classification accuracy for sequences differs substantially from that for single finger movements (Diedrichsen et al., 2012), especially in the ipsilateral, left hemisphere (Figure 4A). Here, single finger movements are represented close to the central sulcus, whereas sequences are represented more prominently in premotor and parietal areas. Secondly, to test the idea of different temporal activation profiles directly, we defined six bilateral regions of interest (ROIs; see Figure 5A and ‘Materials and methods’). Within each region, we identified the main components of the temporal response (see ‘Materials and methods’). The first component yielded the canonical activation profile, while the additional components described temporal variations around this mean time course (Figure 4B). Classification accuracy was highest when using the weight of the first temporal component for each voxel as input to the classifier. When we added the voxel-by-voxel weights for any further temporal component, classification accuracy reduced markedly, indicating that these components did not carry any additional information (Figure 4C)."

While the experimental was not designed to distinguish between instruction- and execution related activity, two insights can be gathered from the analysis. First, classification accuracy for S1 was already above chance for the second TR, which was acquired 2.7–5.4 s after the onset of the number cue, t(15) = 3.335, p=0.002. All other regions showed significant classification accuracy at the third TR, all t(15) > 5.34, p<0.0001. Thus, it is likely that the informative patterns were caused at least partly by instruction-related activity. Secondly, even areas such as OPJ and PMd exhibited sustained classification accuracy over the whole trial. Thus, these areas did not only represent the string of numbers presented on the screen; rather they exhibited a sustained representation of the sequence during the execution phase, during which the number cue was not visible anymore."

To investigate this directly, we employed a newly developed method that consists of a set of classifiers, each using a different number of informative spatial pattern components (Diedrichsen et al., 2013). To illustrate this method, assume that each sequence activated a unique set of voxels. To describe the differences between these four patterns, one would need three linear components (or contrasts), each of which would capture an equivalent amount of variance. Thus, the patterns would be distributed evenly in the space spanned by the three pattern components (Figure 5A, red dots). Consequently, classification accuracy should be highest when taking all three components into account. In contrast, if sequences could be distinguished because they differed on a single variable (e.g., difficulty), then they should be associated with a single activity pattern that is scaled in intensity by different amounts. The patterns would therefore mostly differ along a single pattern component (Figure 5A, blue dots). In this case, classification accuracy should be highest when using only the most informative spatial component (one-dimensional simulation, Figure 5B,C). While we have shown that this is indeed the case when the same movement is executed at different force levels (Diedrichsen et al., 2013), we found here that all sequence representations showed the highest accuracy when using all three available linear components (Figure 5B,C, red line). This was the case in all ROIs and for both untrained sequences (all t(15) > 2.496, p<0.025) and trained sequence (all t(15) > 5.261, p<0.001). Thus, we can conclude that sequences are encoded in unique spatial activation patterns, rather than in differently scaled versions of a single pattern."

This is indeed what we found. We first tested this idea globally, averaging over all fronto-parietal cortical regions. For trained sequences, classification accuracy (Figure 3C, red/purple, Figure 3—figure supplement 1) reached 60%—and was on average significantly higher for trained (38.4%, ±1.39%) than for untrained sequences (34.2%, ±1.76%), t(15) = 2.203, p=0.022. Furthermore, the cortical surface area which encoded the sequences better than chance (within subject threshold: acc > 37.5%, Z > 1.64), increased from 35.12 cm2 (±5.38 cm2) to 46.93 cm2 (±4.65 cm2), t(15) = 1.963, p=0.034. Finally, we also conducted a map-wise comparison between trained and untrained sequences for the classifier using all three spatial components (Figure 3D). After correcting for multiple comparisons over the whole cortical surface, only the increase in left SMA/pre-SMA was significant (uncorrected threshold p=0.002, t(15) > 3.39; p-corrected < 0.012; clustersize = 0.19 cm2). In this area, the accuracy increased from 36% to 46% (Figure 5C)."

Specifically, by looking at how the sequence-specific patterns are distributed in the space of pattern components, we can determine whether sequences activated separate or overlapping sets of voxels. Our data indicates that untrained sequences were associated with unique, but basically random activity patterns. This means that any two activation patterns exhibit some non-overlapping features, but also share a specific amount of shared activity. The predicted accuracy curve when classifying four simulated random patterns using 1–3 spatial components is shown in Figure 5B,C (black line). In each simulation we matched the accuracy for the three-dimensional classifier to the empirically observed accuracy. The resulting prediction for the 1- and two-dimensional classifier characterized the data for untrained sequences quite well (Figure 5B). Only in the IPS was the observed classification accuracy for the one-dimensional classifier lower than predicted, t(15) = 2.247, p=0.040; for all other ROIs, the prediction and data did not differ significantly (all t(15) < 1.206, p>0.247)."

In the extreme case, in which each sequence activates an exclusive set of voxels, the patterns would become evenly distributed in the space of possible patterns (red dots, Figure 5A). The accuracy curves based on such an arrangement is shown as the dashed line in Figure 5C (for details, see Diedrichsen et al., 2013). While the observed classification accuracy curves for trained sequences did not fully reach this extreme prediction, the activity patterns were more evenly distributed than expected for spatially random patterns: The classification accuracy for the one-dimensional classifier deviated significantly from the prediction based on random patterns for S1, M1, PMd, SMA/pre-SMA, and IPS, all t(15) > 2.429, p<0.028."

While trained and untrained sequences were executed at slightly different speeds and average forces (Table 1), the individual differences in overall classification accuracy did not correlate with the difference in MT (p=0.75), force (p=0.51), or error rate (p=0.21). Furthermore, we tested whether the increase in discriminability of cortical activation patterns could have been caused by the reduced behavioral variability that normally accompanies learning. In considering this idea, it is important to keep in mind that classification accuracy is determined both by within-sequence variability and by between-sequences differences. To evaluate both together, we tested how well a linear classifier could discriminate between each set of four sequences based on MT, average force, or error rate, either considered in isolation or in any combination as separate features. None of the seven combinations showed a significant difference between trained and untrained sequences (all t(15) < 1.15, p>0.269; see Table 1). Furthermore, when including the differences in classification accuracy based on all behavioral variables as a covariate, the accuracy difference based on fMRI patterns remained significant, t(15) = 2.56, p=0.01. Thus, the higher classification accuracy for trained sequences was not a simply a consequence of more stable behavioral performance."

While a recent report (Huang et al., 2013) showed increases in split-half correlation of the activity pattern in primary motor cortex for a trained compared to an untrained finger sequence, these authors only used a single trained sequence, and therefore could not distinguish between the component of the activity pattern that is common to any possible trained sequence, and the pattern component that is specific to a single sequence. This, however, is an important distinction: when decomposing our activity patterns (Diedrichsen et al., 2011), we found that 99% of the voxel-by-voxel variance was explained by a pattern component that is common to all trained sequences, with less than 1% being attributable to the sequence-specific component (Figure 7). In most areas, the sequence-specific component was larger for trained sequences, and therefore followed the pattern observed in the classification accuracy. These differences, however, failed to become significant. In contrast, the common component was smaller for trained than untrained sequences (significant for PMd, t(15) = 2.469, p=0.026, and IPS and OPJ, t(15) = 3.573, p<0.003) and therefore followed the pattern found for the average activity (Figure 6)."

This finding may be related to the substantial generalization of learning to the untrained sequences. For example, classification may have relied on populations of neurons that encode for the sequential transitions between pairs of fingers, many of which were shared between trained and untrained sequences. More likely, however, the unique activity patterns for untrained sequences relied on preexisting neuronal coding of sequential context: whether typing on a keyboard or playing an instrument, humans engage in many sequential motor behaviors, and such general representations would discriminate between trained and untrained sequences alike."

While other imaging studies have reported increased activity in some of these regions with increased sequential processing demands (Farooqui et al., 2012; Heim et al., 2012), our study is the first to show that individual voxels are tuned for different sequence of movements. Together with other neurophysiological recording study (Fogassi et al., 2005), our results argue that sequential encoding is not unique to the SMA, but is rather widespread throughout the cortical motor hierarchy."

Some of these regions could represent the sequences phonologically as string of number during subvocal rehearsal (Hartwigsen et al., 2013), abstractly in a spatial reference, or motorically in an intrinsic references frame (Keele et al., 1995). Furthermore, neural populations could code for the order of finger presses or their relative timing (Kornysheva et al., 2013), and representations could be effector-specific or independent of hand that is used to execute the movement (Gallivan et al., 2013). Our experimental design also did not allow us to determine conclusively to what degree sequential decoding relied only on activity related to the execution, or to what degree these patterns were also present during the instruction phase. Further dedicated experiments are needed to identify the exact nature of the sequential representations in identified areas."

Indeed, averaged across all involved areas, we were better able to classify between trained than between untrained sequences. Furthermore, we could show that these training-related changes became most evident when looking at multiple spatial components of the activity patterns. This finding implies two things. First, it shows that the changes in classification accuracy were not due to larger between-sequence differences, or lower within-sequence variability, of a single behavioral factor—otherwise the difference would have been apparent using a classifier that uses only the most informative spatial pattern component. Secondly, it shows that training leads to the formation of a unique spatial activity pattern for each sequence and therefore a more even spacing of the activity patterns in the space of possible patterns. While it is still possible that this observation reflects changes in a combination of multiple other behavioral variables, none of the possible combinations of the behavioral measures was able to explain the observed accuracy difference between trained and untrained sequences. This lends some credibility to the idea that learning caused by the formation of specialized neuronal circuits that encodes different finger transitions or whole sequences."

The latter finding is consistent with specialization of the left hemisphere for complex movements, executed with either the dominant or non-dominant hand (Verstynen et al., 2005). Indeed, our behavioral measures indicate inter-manual transfer of the sequence-specific knowledge to the untrained right hand."

Generally, we observed less activity for trained than untrained sequences, despite the fact that the two conditions were matched for error rate (and hence difficulty) and the trained sequences were executed slightly faster and with higher peak forces. In areas that showed the largest increases in classification accuracy, no changes in average activation were found."

      "content": "Average activity changes during learning are likely complicated by the overlap of two competing tendencies. First, training likely leads to increased recruitment of neuronal populations, as has been shown with expansion of the cortical hand area following skill training (Nudo et al., 1996). Involving larger populations of neurons in motor planning and execution may reduce neuronal noise and lead to less variable performance. Second, the recruited neurons likely become more specialized for specific trained behaviors. Therefore, fewer non-specialized units must be recruited, decreasing the activity for the majority of neurons in a region (Poldrack, 2000). The overlap of increased neuronal recruitment and increased efficiency through specialization (Steele and Penhune, 2010) may explain previously inconsistent results, which suggest that activity in sequence-related regions increases (Grafton et al.,1995; Karni et al., 1995; Floyer-Lea and Matthews, 2005; Hazeltine et al., 1997), decreases (Wu et al., 2004; Poldrack et al., 2005), or changes non-linearly over the course of learning (Xiong et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2010)."

Although average activity decreased in most areas, we found increased bilateral encoding of the trained sequences. This finding has important implications for models of skill development. Examining average activity alone, one might be tempted to conclude that many secondary motor areas play a reduced role in the production of highly trained skills, which may be encoded in a few execution-related areas such as the primary motor cortex (Penhune and Steele, 2012). In contrast, our results indicate that skill learning generates increasingly specialized representations, which are distributed widely across both primary and secondary cortical motor areas."

The input data (xi) consisted of 4 (sequences) × 8 (runs) activation estimates for the p=160 neighboring voxels. Using the data from seven runs, we calculated the mean activation vector for each sequence, and the average PxP within-class covariance matrix Σ, which was regularized by adding 1% of the diagonal mean to all diagonal elements. The activation vectors from the remaining eighth run were then classified by assigning them to the class with the highest likelihood p(x) (for details, see Diedrichsen et al., 2011). By retraining and cross-validating the classifier with all possible training and test sets, we obtained an average classification accuracy. If the neural activation patterns did not differ systematically between sequences, accuracy should be 25% (guessing rate). Systematically higher classification rates indicate that a region showed differential activation patterns for the four sequences, and the size of the classification accuracy served as a measure of the strength of the sequence representation in that region. For between-subject analysis, we z-transformed the classification accuracies, using a normal approximation to the binomial distribution."

Using single value decomposition we then determined the main temporal components of the response for each anatomical ROI (Kay et al., 2008). Instead of the beta-estimate for the canonical hemodynamic response, we submitted the component weights for each voxel and trial to the LDA classifier. The first temporal component reflected the main response and led to the highest classification accuracy in all ROI. We then added each of the other temporal components by using the 160 voxel-weights for first component and the 160 voxel-weights for the additional component as 320 independent features."

In short, to distinguish four unique patterns, at most three linear dimensions (pattern components) are needed. If the patterns only differ in the intensity scaling of a common pattern, then best classification accuracy should be achieved with a classifier that uses only the most informative pattern component of the training data set. If, however, the patterns are evenly distributed in the pattern space, classification accuracy should increase for each additional spatial dimension that the classifier uses. Simulations of classification accuracies under different assumptions are conducted so that the classification accuracies of the three-dimensional classifier matched those of the data (Figure 4E; for details, see Diedrichsen et al., 2013)."

The employed method directly estimates the variability (or strength) of each pattern component across voxels (Diedrichsen et al., 2011).

For each surface node, we selected a surrounding circular region such that p=160 partly touched, or lay between, the pial and grey-white matter surface patches. This resulted in a searchlight radius of 10.4 mm on average. The corresponding classification accuracy was then assigned to the center node. By sequentially selecting each node of the cortical surface, we built up a map of where and how well sequences were represented in the neocortex."

Classification analysis within each selected part of the ROI was performed using randomly drawn groups of 160 voxels, repeating this process 5000 times, and averaging the accuracy over all draws.

Within each ROI we conducted a repeated measurement ANOVA with the factors hemisphere (left vs right), sequence condition (trained vs untrained), and classifier dimensionality (1–3). All F-test were corrected for the number of ROIs using Bonferroni-correction. Thirdly, we also tested difference between trained and untrained sequences using a map-wise contrast. The uncorrected threshold was set to t(15) > 3.39, p<0.002, and family-wise error was controlled by calculating the critical size of the largest super-threshold voxel that would be expected by chance, using Gaussian Field theory as implemented in the fmristat package (Worsley et al., 1996).
