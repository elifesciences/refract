      "content": "Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is secreted by goblet cells of the respiratory tract and, surprisingly, also expressed de novo in mucus secreting cancer lines. siRNA-mediated knockdown of 7343 human gene products in a human colonic cancer goblet cell line (HT29-18N2) revealed new proteins, including a Ca2+-activated channel TRPM5, for MUC5AC secretion. TRPM5 was required for PMA and ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC from the post-Golgi secretory granules. Stable knockdown of TRPM5 reduced a TRPM5-like current and ATP-mediated Ca2+ signal. ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion depended strongly on Ca2+ influx, which was markedly reduced in TRPM5 knockdown cells. The difference in ATP-induced Ca2+ entry between control and TRPM5 knockdown cells was abrogated in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and by inhibition of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Accordingly, MUC5AC secretion was reduced by inhibition of NCX. Thus TRPM5 activation by ATP couples TRPM5-mediated Na+ entry to promote Ca2+ uptake via an NCX to trigger MUC5AC secretion."

This protein is activated when the concentration of Ca2+ inside the cell increases, and its activation allows sodium (Na+) ions to enter the cells.

The secretion of mucus is therefore essential for the normal physiology of the wet mucosal epithelium (Rubin, 2010). The secretory or gel-forming mucin, Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) is one of the major components of the mucus in the airways, and hyper- or hyposecretion of this component is a hallmark of a number of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (Rose and Voynow, 2006). MUC5AC is also expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal tract and, surprisingly, expressed de novo, and upregulated in colonic mucus from cancer and ulcerative colitis patients (Bartman et al., 1999; Kocer et al., 2002; Byrd and Bresalier, 2004; Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007; Bu et al., 2010). MUC5AC is also expressed in response to parasitic infection, which is probably its additional physiological role (Hasnain et al., 2011)."

The heavily glycosylated mucins are sorted, condensed and packed into mucin-secreting granules (MSG). The MSG fuse with the plasma membrane, in a signal-dependent manner, and the condensed mucins expand their volume up to 1000-fold upon secretion (Verdugo, 1993)."

      "content": "The progress to date on the components involved in the trafficking of mucins has recently been thoroughly reviewed (Davis and Dickey, 2008). Basically, mucins are packed (somehow) into MSG at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). MSGs undergo fusion to produce mature condensed granules that are stored in the cytoplasm. The cortical actin acts as a barrier that is reorganized in a Ca2+-dependent reaction through the input of PKCε-dependent phosphorylation of MARCKS (Wollman and Meyer, 2012). The passage of mature MSGs through the actin network also requires Myo II and V. The proteins involved in the docking, priming and fusion of the MSGs are reported to include: Rab3d, Rab27, Hsc70, cysteine string protein, Synaptotagmin 2, Munc13-2, Munc13-4, Munc18b, Syntaxin 2, 3, 11, and VAMP8. However, it is not known how many of these proteins are directly involved in mucin secretion and for some, such as the MARCKS protein, the mechanism is controversial (Stumpo et al., 1995; Arbuzova et al., 2002). The exact myosin involved in the trafficking of MSGs across the actin barrier remains unclear (Rose et al., 2003; Neco et al., 2004; Jerdeva et al., 2005). More importantly, the mechanism of Ca2+-dependent signaling and the components involved in this signaling cascade are not fully characterized."

      "content": "The human colonic adenocarcinoma cells HT29-18N2 (N2) differentiate to goblet cells upon starvation in protein-free medium (Phillips et al., 1995), which increases the production of MUC5AC. Immunofluorescence analysis of accumulated MUC5AC in secretory granules (Figure 1A) shows the differences between starved and nonstarved cells. The increase in protein production of MUC5AC after starvation was confirmed by dot-blotting cell lysates of nonstarved and starved N2 cells (Figure 1B). Quantification of the dot blot revealed a 45-fold increase of MUC5AC protein levels in starved N2 cells compared to nonstarved N2 cells. Our findings with the dot-blot procedure confirm the lack of MUC5AC production in Hela cells (Figure 1B,C). MUC5AC mRNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR also confirmed increased MUC5AC mRNA levels in starved cells (Figure 1D). The fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the plasma membrane requires an external signal, which results in the production of DAG and the release of Ca2+ from internal stores. To induce mucin secretion from the starved N2 cells, we used the DAG mimic, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Starved goblet cells were treated for 2 hr with 2 µM PMA to induce MUC5AC secretion (Figure 1E). The extracellular MUC5AC expands and coats the cell surface (Figure 1E). We took advantage of the stickiness of the mucin film to quantitate secreted MUC5AC. After 2 hr incubation with PMA, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by incubation with an anti-MUC5AC antibody and a secondary fluorescent-labeled antibody to visualize secreted mucin (Figure 1E). To detect the intracellular pool of MUC5AC after PMA-induced release, the cells were washed extensively to remove secreted MUC5AC and then fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody as described above (Figure 1E)."

We tested the effect of perturbing actin cytoskeleton and Ca2+ levels on the PMA-dependent secretion of MUC5AC from starved N2 cells. Starved N2 cells were treated with the drugs that affect actin filaments: Latrunculin A and Jasplakinolide. The cells were also treated with the membrane-permeant Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. The extracellular levels of MUC5AC were measured with the chemiluminescence-based assay. Depolymerization of actin filaments by Latrunculin A had no effect on PMA-stimulated MUC5AC secretion, while BAPTA-AM and the actin-stabilizing agent Jasplakinolide severely affected MUC5AC secretion (Figure 2C). The inhibitory effect of hyperstabilized actin filaments (by Jasplakinolide treatment) on MUC5AC secretion reveals that actin filaments likely act as a barrier to prevent premature fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the cell surface. Inhibition of MUC5AC secretion by BAPTA-AM treatment confirms the known requirement of Ca2+ in the events leading to mucin secretion."

To test whether BFA affected the formation of secretory granules, starved N2 cells were incubated with or without 2 µg/ml BFA. After 45 min cells were fixed and examined by immunofluorescence analysis with an anti-MUC5AC antibody and an antibody to the Golgi membrane specific GRASP65 protein (Figure 2E). The dispersal of GRASP65 with BFA treatment shows that our experimental conditions are effective in disrupting the Golgi apparatus. However, MUC5AC staining was unperturbed by BFA treatment (Figure 2E). We then tested the effect of BFA on the constitutive secretion of newly synthesized proteins. Starved N2 cells were labeled with 35S-methionine and then chased in cold methionine-containing medium in the presence of BFA. Analysis of the medium revealed that BFA severely inhibited the secretion of newly synthesized proteins from the starved N2 cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). To test whether BFA affected the regulated secretion of the secretory granules, starved N2 cells were pretreated with 2 µg/ml BFA for 15 min and then treated with 2 µM PMA for 2 hr in the presence of BFA. MUC5AC was then measured in the extracellular medium by chemiluminescence (Figure 2D). The results reveal that BFA treatment does not affect PMA-dependent MUC5AC secretion under the experimental conditions. Therefore, in our assay, we only measure the secretion of MUC5AC contained in the post-Golgi secretory carriers. This measurement is independent of MUC5AC synthesis, export from the ER to the late Golgi, and its sorting and packing into the secretory granules."

A pool of four different siRNAs targeting the same component was used and every component was analyzed in triplicate. 3 days after transfection, the cells were treated with 2 μM PMA for 2 hr and analyzed by chemiluminescence-based detection of secreted MUC5AC (Figures 2A and 3A). For the data analysis we assumed that the majority of the siRNAs will not affect the secretion of MUC5AC. Data points were normalized by the B-score and the triplicates were ranked according to the Ranking Product method (Breitling et al., 2004; Supplementary file 1). The hits were plotted as median of the B-score and positive hits were selected above and below a B-score of ±1.5. siRNAs that scored above 1.5 B-score were considered as hypersecretory phenotype and those below 1.5 B-score were considered as inhibitors of MUC5AC secretion (hyposecretory phenotype) (Figure 3B). From this analysis we selected 413 components that upon knockdown resulted in hyposecretion and 534 that exhibited a hypersecretion of MUC5AC (Figure 3C). The hits were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and categorized according to their intracellular localization and type. For further analysis we removed 678 proteins from this pool that included secreted proteins, nuclear proteins, proteins affecting protein modification, and those involved in basic metabolism. This narrowed the hits to 114 with hyposecretion and 155 with hypersecretion phenotype (Supplementary file 1)."

This could reveal the convergent function of PIMS in conventional and regulated protein secretion. N2 cells were starved for 6 days, transfected with siRNAs for the individual PIMS, and 3 days later were washed in methionine free medium for 20 min. The cells were then incubated with 35S-methionine containing medium for 15 min and subsequently cultured in methionine containing medium. After 3 hr, the medium was collected and the cells were lysed and measured for total 35S-methionine incorporation. As a control, BFA was added (at 2 µg/ml) during the whole pulse-chase procedure to inhibit general protein secretion. The secreted medium was normalized to the incorporation of 35S-methionine, corresponding volumes precipitated by TCA, and analysis done by SDS-PAGE. We did not detect any obvious changes in the secreted polypeptide pool in starved N2 cells depleted of the individual PIMS compared with control cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). As expected, BFA treatment inhibited general protein secretion (Figure 3—figure supplement 1)."

Total RNA was extracted from starved and unstarved N2 cells and the expression of 34 components selected for MUC5AC secretion (Table 1) was determined by reverse transcription of the mRNA and PCR with specific primers for each component. The PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, quantified and normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (Figure 4A,B). Our findings reveal that 16 of the 34 hits can be detected in N2 cells (Table 1 and Figure 4A). Of these, the mRNA levels of eight components remain unchanged upon starvation compared with unstarved cells (Figure 4A,B). Interestingly, in differentiated N2 cells the levels of GRIK4, KCNIP3, SIPA1, MAPK15, ATF6 and CCR9 were upregulated, while the mRNA levels of SUR1 and SILV were downregulated (Figure 4A,B). As expected, the MUC5AC mRNA was upregulated upon starvation whereas the mRNA levels for the housekeeping gene GAPDH remained unchanged (Figure 4A,B). Based on the data presented thus far we suggest that these 16 proteins are required for MUC5AC secretion and have labelled them as PIMS (Protein Involved in Mucin Secretion) for the sake of simplicity (Table 2)."

      "content": "TRPM5, a hit in our assay, is required for the regulated secretion of insulin (Brixel et al., 2010; Colsoul et al., 2010) and this prompted us to further test its involvement in the regulated secretion of MUC5AC. TRPM5 is a Ca2+-activated monovalent cation-selective channel that responds to warm temperature and participates in the taste-receptor signaling pathway (Perez et al., 2002; Hofmann et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003; Talavera et al., 2005). We generated a shRNA-dependent stable N2 goblet cell line depleted of TRPM5. This procedure resulted in greater than 80% reduction in the TRPM5 mRNA levels (Figure 5A) and a 50% reduction in the quantity of PMA dependent MUC5AC secreted by starved cells (Figure 5B). The defect in secretion could reflect a reduction in the total intracellular protein pool of MUC5AC. Therefore, we probed the total cell lysate from TRPM5 knockdown and control cells with an anti-MUC5AC antibody by dot blot. The dot blot was quantified and revealed no difference in the total MUC5AC contents in the TRPM5 knockdown cells compared with control cells (Figure 5C). We also tested whether the reduction in secretion is due to a defect in granule formation. Intracellular granules were visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody in starved TRPM5-depleted cells. GFP-positive cells indicate the expression of TRPM5 shRNA and show that secretory granules were formed in TRPM5-depleted cells upon starvation (Figure 5D). As shown in Figure 2D, secretion of MUC5AC is BFA-independent and therefore from a post-Golgi pool."

TRPM5 values were normalized to values of the housekeeping gene GAPDH. The knockdown of TRPM5 is represented as relative value compared to control cells. Results are means ± SEM. (N = 5). (B) Control and TRPM5 stable knockdown cells were starved for 6 days and seeded on 96-well plates. At day 9, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PMA for 30 min and analyzed by chemiluminescence using anti-MUC5AC antibody. After the mucin secretion assay these cells were stained with DAPI and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Nuclei were counted using ImageJ and the chemiluminescence value for MUC5AC of each well was normalized to the number of nuclei per well. The y-axis represents relative values with respect to the values of control cells not treated with PMA. Average values ± SEM are plotted as bar graphs (N = 5). Datasets were considered as statistically significant when p<0.0001 (****). (C) N2 cells were starved for 6 days and seeded for dot blot analysis. At day 9 cells were lysed and analyzed by dot blot with an anti-MUC5AC and anti-actin antibody. The intensity of the spots was quantified using ImageJ. Intensities of MUC5AC spots were normalized to the intensity of actin spots. Results are means ± SEM. (N = 6). (D) Control and TRPM5 stable knockdown cells were differentiated by starvation. After starvation cells were fixed, permeabilized and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-MUC5AC antibody (red) and DAPI (blue). Cells shown in green represent expression of GFP, showing that these cells express shRNA specific for TRPM5 and are depleted of TRPM5."

HA-TRPM5 was localized to the apical surface of the polarized non-starved and starved N2 cells while apical MUC5AC staining was only evident in starved N2 cells (Figure 6A). TRPM5 channel (green, Figure 6A) appears proximal to the nucleus in non-starved cells because these cells are shorter in height compared with the starved-differentiated cells. Next, we checked the presence of functional TRPM5 channels at the plasma membrane of starved N2 cells. For this purpose, we carried out whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. Dialyzing N2 cells with Ca2+-free intracellular pipette solutions resulted in negligibly low cationic current recorded; the presence of 1 μM Ca2+ in the pipette solution generated an outwardly rectifying TRPM5-like current (Figure 6B). Replacement of extracellular Na+ by the non-permeant cation N-methyl-D-glucamine reduced the inward current without affecting the outward current (Figure 6B). shRNA-mediated knockdown of TRPM5 abolished Ca2+-dependent cationic currents recorded in starved N2 cells (Figure 6C,D). Together, these results are consistent with the participation of the TRPM5 channel in the generation of the plasma membrane, nonselective, Ca2+-dependent cationic current in N2 cells."

The induction of mucin secretion by ATP is linked to phospholipase C activation, IP3 and DAG generation, and Ca2+ release from the ER (Abdullah et al., 2003; Davis and Dickey, 2008). To test the involvement of TRPM5 in ATP-induced MUC5AC secretion, wild-type and stable TRPM5-depleted N2 cells were differentiated and treated with ATP for 30 min. Knockdown of TRPM5 significantly reduced ATP-induced secretion of MUC5AC (Figure 7A). These findings strongly support the significance of our procedure for the identification of proteins required for the regulated secretion of MUC5AC and confirm the role of TRPM5 in mucin secretion under physiological (extracellular ATP) conditions."

      "content": "Ca2+ entry in response to different secretagogues has been reported for several types of mucin-secreting cells, although the mechanism of Ca2+ influx is poorly understood (Bou-Hanna et al., 1994; Bertrand et al., 2004; Lu et al., 2011). Since Ca2+ is essential for the regulated secretion of MUC5AC and TRPM5 channel activity is known to affect cell membrane potential, we reasoned that the role of TRPM5 in MUC5AC secretion is to modulate secretagogue-induced Ca2+ influx. We tested whether extracellular Ca2+ was required for ATP-dependent MUC5AC secretion. N2 cells were differentiated by starvation and washed; MUC5AC secretion was then induced in either Ca2+-containing or Ca2+-free medium for 30 min in the presence of 100 μM ATP. N2 cells cultured without Ca2+ in the extracellular medium did not secrete MUC5AC upon exposure to ATP. However, there was a sixfold increase in MUC5AC secretion by differentiated N2 cells in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figure 7B). To further investigate the source of Ca2+ in this process we measured MUC5AC secretion in cells treated with thapsigargin, which promotes the release of Ca2+ from the ER (Cantero-Recasens et al., 2010) or in response to the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, which mainly facilitates Ca2+ entry into the cytoplasm from the extracellular medium (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). MUC5AC secretion by ionomycin was significantly higher than treatment with thapsigargin, however, these reagents were less effective, compared with ATP, in eliciting MUC5AC secretion. Together, these results indicate that the contribution of Ca2+ release from internal stores is not as significant as Ca2+ entry from the extracellular medium for MUC5AC secretion by N2 cells."

Control starved N2 cells and N2 cells stably depleted of TRPM5 were treated with 100 µM ATP and intracellular Ca2+ levels were recorded. After ATP treatment, cells depleted of TRPM5 showed reduced increase in intracellular [Ca2+] compared with control cells (Figure 8B). To test if the reduction in intracellular [Ca2+] upon purinergic receptor activation with ATP reflected a defect in Ca2+ influx from the extracellular medium, we measured the elevation in intracellular Ca2+ level by ATP treatment in N2 cells and TRPM5-depleted cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figure 8C). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+ there was no difference between control and TRPM5 depleted cells in ATP-induced increase of intracellular Ca2+ levels, suggesting that TRPM5 participation in ATP-mediated MUC5AC secretion is related to the regulation of the secretagogue-induced Ca2+ entry."

Positive modulation of Ca2+ entry by TRPM5-mediated membrane depolarization has been linked to the activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (Colsoul et al., 2010; Shah et al., 2012). However, we detected neither voltage-gated whole-cell Ca2+ currents (Figure 9—figure supplement 1A) nor depolarization-induced Ca2+ signals (Figure 9—figure supplement 1B) in starved N2 cells. Accordingly, inhibitors of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels did not modify ATP-mediated Ca2+ signals (Figure 9—figure supplement 1C). Therefore, we hypothesized that TRPM5-mediated Na+ entry was coupled to the functioning of a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) in reverse mode, thereby promoting further Ca2+ entry."

      "content": "We investigated the participation of NCX in ATP-mediated MUC5AC secretion and Ca2+ signaling using KB-R9743, an NCX inhibitor that preferentially blocks the reverse Ca2+ influx mode of the transporter (Iwamoto et al., 1996). Control starved N2 cells and N2 cells stably depleted of TRPM5 were pretreated with 50 μM KB-R9743 for 15 min and then incubated with 100 μM ATP. ATP induced MUC5AC secretion was greatly reduced in the presence of the NCX inhibitor (Figure 9A), which suggests that TRPM5- and Ca2+-dependent MUC5AC secretion involves the activity of an NCX. This hypothesis was further examined by measuring ATP-induced Ca2+ signals in the presence of the NCX inhibitor. ATP-induced Ca2+ signals were reduced by ∼ 50% in cells treated with the NCX inhibitor (Figure 9B). Similar to the results obtained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Figure 8D), in the presence of the NCX inhibitor there was no difference in Ca2+ signals between control and TRPM5-depleted N2 cells (Figure 9B). These results suggest that N2 cells exhibit an ATP-induced Ca2+ entry mechanism that is consistent with the operation of an NCX in reverse mode and this control mechanism is lost in N2 cells depleted of TRPM5."

      "content": "There are 17 different kinds of mucin genes and their products are either secreted or transported and inserted into the plasma membrane. The secreted gel-forming mucins MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6 are produced by goblet cells, which are present in the epithelia and submucosal glands of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract (Thornton et al., 2008; McGuckin et al., 2011). Surprisingly, human pathologies such as colon cancer and ulcerative colitis produce MUC5AC de novo, which is then secreted (Bartman et al., 1999; Kocer et al., 2002; Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007; Bu et al., 2010). In general, mucins are produced as a result of cell differentiation and the newly synthesized mucins, like all other secretory proteins, are transported from the ER to the Golgi membranes. In the Golgi complex, the secreted forms of mucins are sorted and packed into granules; the granules mature, fuse with the plasma membrane, predominantly by the influx of Ca2+ into the cells, and release their content. In cells of the gastro-intestinal lining (Bou-Hanna et al., 1994; Barcelo et al., 2001; Bertrand et al., 2004) and eye conjunctiva (Li et al., 2012) influx of extracellular Ca2+ participates in the release of mucins from the secretory granules. Ca2+-dependent events are also essential for the release of mucins from the respiratory tract, however, the source of Ca2+ is unclear. The general view is that mucin secretion in the airways is dependent on Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and independent of extracellular Ca2+ (Kemp et al., 2004; Davis and Dickey, 2008). However, extracellular Ca2+ is required for mucin secretion from cholinergic stimulated swine airway submucosal glands (Lu et al., 2011) as well as by cold and menthol stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (Li et al., 2011). The involvement of extracellular Ca2+ in mucin secretion is therefore likely to be cell type, signal, and mucin specific. The synthesis and secretion of mucins is controlled by a large number of distinct stimuli, which poses additional problems for the identification of proteins involved in mucin homeostasis (Forstner et al., 1994; Stanley and Phillips, 1994; Epple et al., 1997; Slomiany and Slomiany, 2005)."

Our antibody-based detection of secreted MUC5AC is relatively easy, quantitative, and highly accurate. It involves starvation-induced synthesis of MUC5AC, which is then released by treating the cells with PMA. It has recently been shown that secretion of total polymeric mucins from goblet-cell metaplastic human bronchial epithelial cultures is inhibited by BFA treatment (Okada et al., 2010). This likely represents secretion of newly synthesized mucin that is secreted at some basal rate. PMA mediated MUC5AC secretion reported here is unaffected by BFA treatment (Figure 2D,E). Our assay, therefore, measures release of MUC5AC from the post Golgi secretory storage granules."

The identification of SIPA1 and PLEK2 could help reveal the components involved in regulating Rap1, which is known to regulate actin filament dynamics in the events leading to the docking/fusion of the MUC5AC-containing secretory granules. SILV is required for the early stages of melanosome biogenesis, and goblet cells express SILV but are not known to make melanosomes. It is reasonable to propose that SILV performs an analogous function in the maturation of MUC5AC granules in the goblet cells. TAB1 and MAPK15 are likely involved in stress response-mediated synthesis and secretion of MUC5AC. The cell-surface ion channels and the GPCRs are likely involved in signaling events that lead to the secretion of MUC5AC. Future analysis of these proteins will help reveal their significance in MUC5AC homeostasis."

Bitter, sweet and umami tastants are detected by GPCRs that signal through gustducin and PLCβ2 in order to produce DAG and IP3. IP3 activates the release of Ca2+ from the ER, which then activates TRPM5 (Hofmann et al., 2003; Liu and Liman, 2003). The activated TRPM5 affects membrane potential to control events leading to the sensation of bitterness. Interestingly, bitter taste receptors (GPCRs) are expressed in airway smooth muscle and GPCRs coupled to Gαq or Gαs control muscle contraction and relaxation, respectively (Deshpande et al., 2010). A large number of GPCRs regulate taste signaling, but it is not clear which family members are expressed in the goblet cells and linked to the activation of TRPM5. We have found several GPCRs and ion channels that are expressed in the goblet cells and required for MUC5AC secretion. It would be important to test whether any of these GPCRs are directly linked to TRPM5 activation in the goblet cells and therefore in the events leading MUC5AC secretion."

      "content": "The activity of TRPM5, and its close relative TRPM4, has been shown to couple intracellular Ca2+ to changes in membrane potential and either an activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels favouring further Ca2+ increase (Earley et al., 2004; Colsoul et al., 2010; Uchida and Tominaga, 2011; Shah et al., 2012) or a reduction in the electrochemical gradient for store-operated Ca2+ entry (Vennekens et al., 2007). Our results provide evidence for a novel link between TRPM5 activity and the control of intracellular Ca2+ signaling via the functional coupling of TRPM5 and NCX. NCX at the plasma membrane is one of the major means to extrude Ca2+ (in exchange for Na+) from the cells. However, this transporter can also function in the reverse mode to allow Ca2+ entry when intracellular Na+ concentration increases. Significant Na+ entry is expected to occur during activation of TRPM5 following IP3-mediated Ca2+ release. Sodium entering through the TRPM5 would accumulate intracellularly, thus promoting NCX to act in the reverse mode and permit Ca2+ entry in exchange for the exiting Na+. Such a coupling between endogenous NCX and heterologously expressed Na+ and Ca2+ permeable TRPC3 channel has been reported (Rosker et al., 2004). However, our observation describes for the first time the functional coupling between endogenous TRPM5 channel and NCX, and its physiological relevance in the context of mucin secretion."

It is important now to test the expression of PIMS in cells of the respiratory and gastric lining; their involvement in secretion of MUC5AC and other secreted mucins such as MUC2 to understand the mechanisms of mucin homeostasis."

Cells were washed in PBS and incubated with a donkey anti-mouse Alexa 488 coupled antibody (Invitrogen), diluted at 1:1000 in 4% BSA/PBS, and DAPI. Cells were washed in PBS and mounted in FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA). For the detection of secreted MUC5AC, differentiated N2 cells were treated with 2 µM PMA for 2 hr at 37°C. The secreted MUC5AC was fixed on the cells by adding PFA to the cells at a final concentration of 4% for 30 min at RT. The cells were then processed for immunofluorescence analysis (as described before) without the permeabilization step with Triton X-100. For the removal of secreted MUC5AC, cells were incubated for 2 hr with 2 µM PMA at 37°C. The cells were then placed on ice and washed 2× with ice cold PBS. Subsequently, cells were incubated in 1 mM DTT/0.05% Trypsin-EDTA 1× (Invitrogen)/PBS for 10 min at 4°C, following four washes in ice-cold PBS and two washes in 4% BSA/PBS. The cells were then fixed in 4% PFA/PBS for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 4% BSA/PBS and processed for immunofluorescence as described before. Cells were imaged with a confocal microscope (SP5; Leica) using the 63× Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective. For detection, the following laser lines were applied: DAPI, 405 nm; and Alexa Fluor 488, 488 nm; Alexa Fluor 568, 561 nm. Pictures were acquired using the Leica software and converted to TIFF files in ImageJ (version 1.44o; National Institutes of Health)."

To record voltage-gated calcium currents we employed an external solution containing (in mM): 140 tetraethylammonium-Cl, 3 CsCl, 5 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES and 10 glucose (pH 7.4 adjusted with Tris); and an intracellular solution: 140 CsCl, 1 EGTA, 4 Na2ATP, 0,1 Na3GTP and 10 HEPES (pH 7.2–7.3 adjusted with Tris; and 295–300 mosmoles/l). To record TRPM5 currents we used an external solution containing: 140 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 MgCl2, 5 Glucose, 10 Hepes, pH was adjusted to 7.4 with Tris, and 300–305 mosmoles/l; and internal solution: 140 Cs acetate, 0.85 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2 ATP, 0.5 GTP, pH 7.2 adjusted with Tris. Free intracellular calcium concentration to record TRPM5 current was adjusted to either 1 μM or <50 nM (0 Ca solution) with EGTA as calculated with WEBMAXC (http://www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/webmaxcS.htm)."
