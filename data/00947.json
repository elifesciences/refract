The membrane determinant to initiate the formation of autophagosomes remains elusive. Here, we establish a cell-free assay based on LC3 lipidation to define the organelle membrane supporting early autophagosome formation. In vitro LC3 lipidation requires energy and is subject to regulation by the pathways modulating autophagy in vivo. We developed a systematic membrane isolation scheme to identify the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) as a primary membrane source both necessary and sufficient to trigger LC3 lipidation in vitro. Functional studies demonstrate that the ERGIC is required for autophagosome biogenesis in vivo. Moreover, we find that the ERGIC acts by recruiting the early autophagosome marker ATG14, a critical step for the generation of preautophagosomal membranes."

For example, when nutrients are abundant, cells can grow or proliferate; in times of scarcity, however, they must conserve resources for essential tasks. In particular, during periods of starvation, cells can cannibalize themselves in a process called autophagy, which literally means ‘self-eating’. Structures called autophagosomes engulf bits of cytoplasm and carry the contents to the digestive compartment of the cell, the lysosome, to be broken down into their constituent parts. This can include the degradation of proteins into amino acids, which can then be recycled into other proteins needed by the cell."

This pathway begins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where many of these proteins are made. From the ER, the proteins move to a compartment called the Golgi apparatus, which then sends them to their destinations, or to the lysosome to be broken down. Between the ER and Golgi they pass through a structure called the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)."

To identify which of these membranes might be involved, Ge et al. focused on a protein called LC3 that is a key marker for the formation of the autophagosome. This protein is recruited to the growing autophagosome by a lipid, so discovering which membranes can add a lipid to LC3 should shed light on the assembly process."

Additionally, the lipid was only added when signaling pathways that stimulate autophagy—such as the PI3K pathway—were activated. Together, these results provide insight into the mechanism of autophagosome formation, and the structures in the cell that participate in this process."

      "content": "In the process of starvation-induced autophagy, several upstream signals are triggered, including inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), and activation of the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and AMP kinase (AMPK) (Noda and Ohsumi, 1998; Wei et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2011; Rubinsztein et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2013). These signals are conveyed to activate the serine/threonine-protein kinase complex containing the Atg1 homologs ULK1/2, ATG13, FIP200 (RB1CC1) and ATG101 (C12orf44) (Mizushima, 2010). Together with upstream signals, this complex promotes the formation and membrane docking of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3 (PtdIns3)-kinase (PI3K) complex consisting of ATG14 (ATG14L/Barkor), the Atg6 homologue BECN1 (Beclin1), VPS34 (PIK3C3) and VPS15 (p150) for phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) production (Obara and Ohsumi, 2011). Subsequently, DFCP1 (ZFYVE1), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated PI3P binding protein, is recruited to the site of newly-generated PI3P to form omegasomes (Axe et al., 2008). This is followed by two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems to produce the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-lipidated ATG8/LC3, which initiates the formation of a preautophagosomal organelle termed the phagophore or isolation membrane (Mizushima et al., 1998a, 1998b; Ichimura et al., 2000; Geng and Klionsky, 2008). The membrane then expands and engulfs cytoplasmic components. Finally, the crescent-shaped tubular membrane seals to form a double-membraned autophagosome with cytoplasmic components enclosed within the inner membrane. Fusion of the autophagosome with the lysosome leads to the breakdown of the inner membrane together with the trapped cytosolic material (Mizushima et al., 1998a; Burman and Ktistakis, 2010; Yang and Klionsky, 2010; Weidberg et al., 2011; Rubinsztein et al., 2012)."

      "content": "A long-standing quest in the autophagy field has been to define the origin of the autophagosomal membrane. Recent data suggest a multi-membrane source model for autophagosome biogenesis. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports PI3P-dependent formation of the omegasome, a cradle for phagophore generation and elongation (Axe et al., 2008; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009; Yla-Anttila et al., 2009). The outer membrane of the mitochondrion may also supply lipids for the phagophore and autophagosome (Hailey et al., 2010). Recently, a study by Hamasaki et al. (Hamasaki et al., 2013) indicates the ER–mitochondrial junction as being required for autophagosome biogenesis, possibly reconciling these two origins. In addition, clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane have been shown to promote phagophore expansion through the SNARE protein VAMP7 and its partner SNAREs (Ravikumar et al., 2010; Moreau et al., 2011). Moreover, ATG9-positive vesicles cycle between distinct cytoplasmic compartments to deliver membrane to a developing autophagosome or, in yeast, to phagophore assembly sites (PAS) (Young et al., 2006; Sekito et al., 2009; Mari et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2011; Orsi et al., 2012; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Autophagosomes may also acquire membrane from other sources including Golgi (Geng et al., 2010; Ohashi and Munro, 2010; Yen et al., 2010; van der Vaart et al., 2010), early endosomes (Longatti et al., 2012) and vesicles budding from the ER and Golgi (Hamasaki et al., 2003; Zoppino et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2012). Although tremendous progress has been made, a direct functional link between a membrane source and autophagosome biogenesis has not been established. Furthermore, the identity of the membrane determinant that responds to a stress signal to initiate autophagosome formation is unknown."

We establish a cell-free system that reflects many of the physiological and biochemical landmarks of early events in the autophagic pathway and define the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), a membrane compartment between ER and Golgi for cargo sorting and recycling (Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006), as a key membrane determinant for autophagosome biogenesis."

The level of LC3 lipidation has long been a reliable measure of autophagy activity in vivo (Klionsky et al., 2012). In vitro LC3 lipidation has recently been reconstituted with synthetic liposomes, recombinant LC3 and other components including the ATG12–ATG5 conjugate, ATG7 and ATG3 (Sou et al., 2006; Hanada et al., 2007; Oh-oka et al., 2008; Shao et al., 2007; Gao et al., 2010). We sought to capture this modification in a more physiological context by relying on native membranes and cytosol to provide the core components of LC3 lipidation as well as any regulatory proteins that may be required for early autophagosome formation."

Cells lacking ATG5 are deficient in starvation-induced autophagy and phagophore formation (Mizushima et al., 2001). Hence they only contain unmodified LC3 (LC3-I) in both cytosol and membrane fractions (Figure 1A). Cytosols derived from WT cells (including WT MEF [mouse embryonic fibroblast], COS-7 [Cercopithecus aethiops fibroblast-like kidney cells], and HEK293T [human embryonic kidney 293T cells]) were highly enriched in LC3-I whereas the lipidated form of LC3 (LC3-II) sedimented with membranes (Kabeya et al., 2000 and Figure 1A). We incubated membranes from Atg5 KO MEFs with cytosol from WT MEFs in the presence of GTP and an ATP regeneration system (Figure 1B) and observed the formation of LC3-II in a time- (Figure 1B) and ATP-dependent manner (Figure 1C)."

In a crude fractionation study, we found that the in vitro-generated LC3-II partitioned in the 16,000×g membrane fraction (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Moreover, the in vitro product resisted extraction with urea or Na2CO3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and was delipidated to LC3-I by ATG4B (Figure 1D), a cysteine protease that cleaves the C-terminal tail of LC3 and removes PE from LC3-II (Tanida et al., 2004). These properties are shared with LC3-II generated in vivo (Kabeya et al., 2000; Tanida et al., 2004)."

To test the ATG5 dependence and starvation effect on in vitro LC3 lipidation, we incubated cytosols from either untreated or starved WT cells or Atg5 KO MEFs with the corresponding membranes from Atg5 KO MEFs (Figure 2A). LC3-II formation was stimulated about threefold in incubations containing cytosol from starved WT MEFs and membranes from starved Atg5 KO MEFs, compared to incubations containing cytosol and membranes from non-starved MEFs (Figure 2A). Cytosol from Atg5 KO MEFs did not generate LC3-II when combined with membranes from Atg5 KO MEFs (Figure 2A). In addition, cytosols from COS-7 and HEK293T cells also reconstituted starvation-induced lipidation of LC3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These data suggest that the cell-free LC3 lipidation is regulated by starvation-induced components in cells and is dependent on ATG5."

Inhibition of the PI3K activity prevents autophagy. LC3 lipidation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and wortmannin, two PI3K inhibitors of different potency but which act in the same concentration ranges to block autophagy in intact cells (Figure 2B and Klionsky et al., 2012)."

To study the role of PI3P in the in vitro reaction, we isolated a FYVE domain derived from FENS-1 (WDFY1), an endosomal protein (Ridley et al., 2001; Axe et al., 2008), and included the peptide in a lipidation reaction mixture (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B; Figure 2C). As reported in intact cells, the FYVE domain peptide inhibited LC3 lipidation in a dose-dependent manner whereas a cysteine to serine (C/S) mutation, which abolishes the ability of FYVE to bind PI3P (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,C and Axe et al., 2008), had no effect on lipidation (Figure 2C)."

In order to control the level of substrate, we isolated tagged recombinant LC3 expressed in Escherichia coli. LC3 is synthesized as a precursor that is processed by ATG4 cleavage to expose a glycine at position 120, the site of PE attachment (Tanida et al., 2004). Cell-free lipidation of recombinant T7-LC3 (aa1-120) required the glycine at position 120 and responded in a cytosol- and membrane concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B and C). Lipidated T7-LC3 sedimented along with membranes at 16,000×g, a property shared with the endogenous LC3-II generated in vitro (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and Figure1—figure supplement 1A)."

Furthermore, cytosol deficient in ATG7, ATG3 or ATG5, key factors in the ubiquitin-like pathway for LC3 lipidation, failed to generate lipidated T7-LC3 in vitro (Figure 3D,E and F)."

We found that cytosol from starved or untreated Ulk1 KO MEFs reduced lipidation two to threefold relative to cytosol from WT cells (Figure 3G). Furthermore, T7-LC3 lipidation was stimulated two to threefold by two MTOR inhibitors, rapamycin (Heitman et al., 1991) and Torin 1 (Liu et al., 2010), known to induce autophagy (Figure 3H,I). Thus, for endogenous and recombinant LC3, the cell-free reaction reflects and responds to the major regulatory pathways of autophagy."

The PC level of each fraction was measured and normalized so that the lipidation activity for equal amounts of PC (specific activity) could be determined (Figure 5A,B and C). The 25k and 100k fractions had significant lipidation activity (Figure 5A,B). The total activity contained in each fraction was calculated by multiplying the specific activity by the PC level (Figure 5D). The 25k pellet contained most (>70%) of the total activity, whereas the 100k pellet had little (<10%) total activity due to low levels of membrane. The 25k membrane was enriched in peroxisomes (PMP70/ABCD3), late endosomes (LAMP2) and cis-Golgi (GM130/GOLGA2). This fraction also contained membranes from the ERGIC (SEC22B and ERGIC53/LMAN1), plasma membrane/early endosomes (PM/Endo, TFR), ER (RPN1), ER exit sites (ERES, active sites on the ER that generate COPII-coated vesicles, SEC12), lysosomes (Cathepsin D), and ATG9 vesicles. Low levels of a mitochondrial marker (Prohibitin 1) and almost no trans-Golgi (TGN38/TGOLN2) or nuclear (Histone H4) compartments (Figure 5A) were detected."

      "content": "To further refine the membrane source of T7-LC3 lipidation activity, we centrifuged the L fraction on an OptiPrep gradient and collected ten fractions from the top (Figure 4). The lipidation activity was distributed in fractions two through four which co-distributed with SEC22B and ERGIC53 (Figure 7), two ERGIC markers (Zhang et al., 1999; Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006). Intriguingly, PE, the substrate for LC3 lipidation, was not enriched in the fractions that triggered T7-LC3 lipidation (Figure 7B). The high activity of these membrane fractions was not caused by selective enrichment of the autophagic factors directly contributing to LC3 lipidation, as all of these factors are enriched in the cytosol, or by influencing the formation of the ATG5–12–16 complex essential for LC3 lipidation (Fujita et al., 2008) compared with other membrane fractions (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). These data indicate that factors other than those directly involved in catalyzing LC3 lipidation contribute to the high lipidation activity of these membranes. We further found that the lipidation reaction triggered by the ERGIC-enriched membranes was enhanced by cytosol from starved cells and was inhibited by wortmannin and FYVE peptide (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). These data suggest that the lipidation activity of the isolated membranes is controlled by the pathway(s) that regulate autophagy in vivo."

In both experiments, the immunoisolated membranes had substantially increased activity (about twofold or more than fivefold in the SEC22B or KDELR immunoisolated membranes, respectively) compared to the total input membrane (Figure 8B,C). In contrast, immunoisolation of lysosomes, plasma membrane/endosomes or ER did not enrich the lipidation activity compared to the total input membrane (Figure 8D,E and F). Therefore the data suggest that ERGIC is the most active membrane substrate for LC3 lipidation."

Hamasaki et al. suggested that this zone of adhesion might trigger the formation of the autophagosome (Hamasaki et al., 2013). Such a specialized patch of the ER could be an immediate precursor of the autophagosome. Markers of this adhesion were separated from the ERGIC fraction and the adhesion membrane isolated by the protocol of Wieckowski et al. (Wieckowski et al., 2009) contained little lipidation activity (Figure 8—figure supplement 1), suggesting this membrane alone may not be the direct template for LC3 lipidation. Consistent with Hamasaki et al., a fraction of ATG14 appeared on MAM in a starvation-stimulated manner (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B)."

H89 is a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor that blocks COPII-coated vesicle assembly by preventing SAR1 binding to ER membrane when used at a high concentration (Chijiwa et al., 1990; Aridor and Balch, 2000). Brefeldin A (BFA) is a fungal metabolite that inhibits ARF1 activation (Peyroche et al., 1999). Treatment of cells with a high concentration of H89 (100 µM) led to the dispersal of ERGIC53 whereas GM130, a cis-Golgi marker, remained in the perinuclear region, suggesting that the ERGIC is disrupted but not the cis-Golgi (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). A low concentration of H89 (10 µM), which is enough to inhibit PKA, did not affect the localization of either ERGIC53 or GM130 (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). BFA treatment collapsed the Golgi into puncta colocalizing with ERGIC53 (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). Treatment of cells with 100 µM H89 after BFA treatment dispersed both ERGIC53 and GM130 (Figure 9—figure supplement 1)."

Membrane from cells treated with a high but not a low concentration of H89 (100 µM vs 10 µM) lost the ability to activate LC3 lipidation (Figure 9A). Membranes from BFA-treated cells did not show diminished lipidation activity, nor did BFA mitigate or enhance the effect of H89 treatment on lipidation activity (Figure 9A). Clofibrate is a peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonist that inhibits ER-to-Golgi transport and promotes retrograde transport of Golgi vesicles back to the ER through an unknown mechanism independent of PPAR activation (de Figueiredo and Brown, 1999). Clofibrate treatment led to the dispersal of ERGIC53 and GM130 (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). Like H89, membranes from clofribate-treated cells failed to promote LC3 lipidation (Figure 9B). As controls, kbNB142-70, a PKD inhibitor (Bravo-Altamirano et al., 2011), had no affect and Pitstop 2, a clathrin inhibitor (von Kleist et al., 2011), only moderately decreased in vitro LC3 lipidation (Figure 9B)."

Alternatively, cells were directly treated with the indicated drugs: 100 µM H89, 500 µM clofibrate, 50 µM kbNB142-70 and 50 µM Pitstop2 (B). Total membranes from the cells were collected, the lipidation reaction with T7-LC3 was performed and the products evaluated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. Ctr, control (C) Blocking ERGIC disruption preserved the in vitro lipidation of LC3. Atg5 KO MEFs were treated with control, H89 or clofibrate (Clofi) in the absence or presence of nocodazole (Noco). Lipidation reactions with the total membranes from the treated cells were performed. (D–F) The in vitro lipidation of LC3 recovers with restoration of ERGIC. Atg5 KO MEF cells were treated with BFA followed by 100 µM H89. Cells were then washed with fresh medium to remove the drugs and, at indicated intervals, samples were collected for immunofluorescence (D) or total membrane collection for the in vitro lipidation reaction (E). Quantification of the recovery of lipidation activity, ERGIC and Golgi are shown in (F). Bar, 10 µm. Quantification of lipidation activity was shown as the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I (II/I)."

Disruption of microtubules by nocodazole inhibited the retrograde transport of ERGIC53 towards ER induced by H89 or clofibrate, preserving its punctate localization (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). Correspondingly, the inhibitory effects of H89 and clofibrate were reversed in respect to the cell-free lipidation activity (Figure 9C). To examine the reversibility of these effects, we treated cells with BFA and H89 for 20 min and then washed the cells into fresh medium for periods up to 40 min (Puri and Linstedt, 2003). ERGIC53 puncta began to reappear within 2 min and the normal localization was fully restored by 20 min. Cis-Golgi regeneration, indicated by the perinuclear accumulation of GM130, was slower and was completed by about 30 min (Figure 9D,F). Aliquots examined in the cell-free LC3 lipidation assay displayed a rapid return of activity correlating with the kinetics of ERGIC recovery (Figure 9E,F). These results support our membrane fractionation results concerning the role of the ERGIC in lipidation of LC3."

We then monitored autophagosome biogenesis by immunofluorescence analysis of LC3 puncta formation (Klionsky et al., 2012). Under normal conditions, LC3 is dispersed in the cell, indicating a low level of autophagy (Figure 10A). Starvation-induced LC3 puncta formation was abolished by H89 (100 µM) and clofibrate (Figure 10A,B). Depressed formation of LC3 puncta was not due to enhanced autophagosome turnover because chloroquine, which blocks a late step in autophagy (Klionsky et al., 2012), did not mitigate the effect of H89 (100 µM) or clofibrate (Figure 10A,B). Puncta formation of another phagophore marker, ATG16 (Fujita et al., 2008), was also blocked by ERGIC depletion (Figure 10—figure supplement 1)."

In order to determine whether the observed decrease in the number of LC3 puncta could be due to PKA inhibition and not loss of ERGIC, we tested a low concentration of H89 that inhibits PKA but has no effect on the ERGIC (Figure 9—figure supplement 1). In contrast to the effect of a high concentration of H89 (100 µM), cells treated with the low concentration (10 µM) showed a moderate increase in LC3 puncta with or without chloroquine (Figure 10A,B). A recent study also reported that PKA inhibition promotes autophagy (Cherra et al., 2010), thus PKA inhibition appears not to be the basis of the effect of H89 on autophagy."

A GTP-bound mutant of SAR1A (H79G) locks COPII membrane cargos on the ERES and a GDP-bound mutant, SAR1A T34N, completely blocks COPII coat formation (Ward et al., 2001). Overexpression of either SAR1A H79G or T34N led to dispersed ERGIC53 localization (Figure 10—figure supplement 2) and inhibited starvation-induced LC3 puncta formation in both control and chloroquine-treated cells (Figure 10C,D). We conclude that the ERGIC is a precursor of or contributes to the formation of the autophagosome."

Upon starvation, ATG14 is recruited to a membrane along with the rest of the class III PI3K complex to generate PI3P (Matsunaga et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2008; Zhong et al., 2009; Matsunaga et al., 2010). These events can be visualized by the localization of ATG14 and DFCP1 to puncta in starved cells (Axe et al., 2008; Matsunaga et al., 2010). To test the role of ERGIC in this pathway, we treated starved cells with H89. As shown in Figure 11, 100 µM H89 but not 10 µM H89 prevented the formation of both ATG14 and DFCP1 puncta (Figure 11A,B). Similar inhibition was also observed in starved cells expressing the two SAR1A mutants, H79G and T34N (Figure 11C,D)."

Cells were lysed and membranes from a post-nuclear supernatant fraction were mixed with cytosol from starved HEK293 cells transfected with tagged forms of ATG14 and DFCP1. The mixes were incubated in the presence of ATP and a regeneration system. Membranes were resolved on an OptiPrep buoyant density step gradient. We observed recruitment of tagged ATG14 and DFCP1 to a buoyant membrane fraction from untreated but much less from H89-treated cells (Figure 12). Recruitment was dependent on membranes, and stimulated by starvation (Figure 12—figure supplement 1). In starved cells, ATG14 acts upstream of PI3K activity whereas DFCP1 puncta formation requires PI3P generation (Itakura and Mizushima, 2010). Correspondingly, membranes from cells treated with PI3K inhibitors recruited ATG14 but not DFCP1 (Figure 12—figure supplement 1B and C). In addition to the membrane recruitment result, immunofluorescence studies showed colocalization of ATG14 and DFCP1 with ERGIC53 after starvation (Figure 12—figure supplement 2). We conclude that the ERGIC membrane is an early site for the assembly of proteins responsible for the formation of the phagophore membrane."

We first developed a cell-free assay based on in vitro LC3 lipidation to measure autophagosome biogenesis (Figures 1–3). By combining this assay with membrane fractionation, we identified an ERGIC-enriched fraction as the most active membrane to trigger LC3 lipidation (Figures 4–7). Next we used organelle immuno-/inhibitor depletion and immunoisolation to demonstrate that the ERGIC is necessary and sufficient to support LC3 lipidation (Figures 8 and 9). Finally, we provided evidence that the ERGIC membrane acts by recruiting ATG14 to initiate PI3K activity, an early step essential for autophagosome biogenesis (Figures 10–12)."

Indeed, it is improbable that one organelle contributes all the membrane constituents that become part of a mature autophagosome. Nonetheless, it seems likely that one membrane responds to the signal that triggers autophagosome formation and the identity of that membrane has remained elusive. Our isolation of the ERGIC as the locus of LC3 lipidation is in line with morphological studies that describe an omegasome structure projecting directly from the ER membrane (Axe et al., 2008; Hayashi-Nishino et al., 2009). However, our results show clearly that the bulk ER membrane is not the site of lipidation, thus if the omegasome arises from the ER, it must become modified in some way to be active for LC3 lipidation."

This process occurs upstream of phagophore generation (Itakura and Mizushima, 2010). Our data show that in starved cells and in isolated membranes, the presence of ERGIC is required for the efficient membrane recruitment of ATG14 and DFCP1 (Figures 11 and 12). Thus the ERGIC may play a role in an early stage of phagophore formation by providing a platform to recruit the class III PI3K complex and provide precursor membranes for phagophore initiation, which may be further expanded in a special subdomain of ER."

Perhaps the tubular and curved structure of the ERGIC (Appenzeller-Herzog and Hauri, 2006) in mammalian cells favors recruitment of the ATG14 complex and subsequently of other components. ATG14 has been reported to sense membrane curvature via an amphipathic alpha helix located in a C-terminal ‘BATS’ domain (Fan et al., 2011). In yeast, it has been shown that highly curved membranes positive for ATG9 are delivered to the PAS (Mari et al., 2010; Nair et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2012). Subsequently, the curvature sensing protein Atg1 recruits Atg13 and the Atg17–31–29 protein complex to initiate the formation of the phagophore (Ragusa et al., 2012). The suggested requirement for a tubular membrane together with the possible existence of an integral membrane protein(s) that triggers ATG14 recruitment are now open for biochemical analysis."

The GST-FYVE, GST-FYVE(C/S) and T7-LC3 plasmids were constructed by subcloning the indicated inserts from the GFP-TM-FYVE, GFP-TM-FYVE(C/S) constructs (Nicholas Ktistakis, Babraham Institute, UK) and Myc-LC3 plasmids into pGEX4T1 and pET28a vectors. The encoded proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 and affinity purified with glutathione or Ni Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). The Flag-GFP-ER-TM plasmid was generated by PCR insertion of a Flag tag into the GFP-ER-TM plasmid (Nicholas Ktistakis, Babraham Institute, UK). The human Vangl2-myc plasmid was described before (Guo et al., 2013). Inserts from the pGEX-Sar1As (Kim et al., 2005) were subcloned into the DsRed-Monomer-N1 vector to generate DsRed-tagged SAR1A plasmids."

Homogenates were either centrifuged at 100,000×g for 45 min to collect total membranes or subjected to sequential differential centrifugation at 1,000×g (10 min), 3,000×g (10 min), 25,000×g (20 min) and 100,000×g (30 min, TLA100.3 rotor, Beckman) to collect the membranes sedimented at each speed. The PC content of each fraction was measured as described before (Ge et al., 2011). Membrane fractions containing equal amounts of PC were used to test LC3 lipidation activity. The 25,000×g membrane pellet, which contained the highest activity, was suspended in 0.75 ml 1.25 M sucrose buffer and overlayed with 0.5 ml 1.1 M and 0.5 ml 0.25 M sucrose buffer (Golgi isolation kit; Sigma). Centrifugation was performed at 120,000×g for 2 hr (TLS 55 rotor, Beckman), after which two fractions, one at the interface between 0.25 M and 1.1 M sucrose (L fraction) and the pellet on the bottom (P fraction), were separated. Activities of the two fractions were then tested as described above, and the L fraction was selected and suspended in 1 ml 19% OptiPrep for a step gradient containing 0.5 ml 22.5%, 1 ml 19% (sample), 0.9 ml 16%, 0.9 ml 12%, 1 ml 8%, 0.5 ml 5% and 0.2 ml 0% OptiPrep each. Each density of OptiPrep was prepared by diluting 50% OptiPrep (20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.4, 42 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA) with a buffer containing 20 mM Tricine-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose and 1 mM EDTA. The OptiPrep gradient was centrifuged at 150,000×g for 3 hr (SW 55 Ti rotor, Beckman) and subsequently ten fractions, 0.5 ml each, were collected from the top. Fractions were diluted with B88 buffer and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000×g for 1 hr. The activity of each fraction was determined and the distribution of the activity was compared with that of each membrane marker. Membranes containing an equal amount of PC from each fraction were also measured for PE content using an enzymatic assay (Hokazono et al., 2011)."

ERGIC recovery quantification was described previously (Puri and Linstedt, 2003). Golgi recovery was quantified by manually counting the percent of cells displaying a perinuclear location of GM130. For each sample, more than 100 cells were counted. Immunoblot was performed as previously described (Ge et al., 2008, 2011) and dot blot was carried out according to the PIP Strip user manual (Echelon). Images were acquired and bands were quantified with Chemidoc MP Imaging System (Bio-Rad)."

Nonetheless, we have performed a protease protection assay hoping to observe the progressive enclosure of lipidated LC3 within a sealed compartment as might be expected when the autophagosome precursor membrane closes to segregate cytosolic components. Unfortunately, on repeated tests in prolonged incubations, we find little evidence for reproducible protease protection of the LC3-II species. We are not discouraged by this because the overall pathway is likely to be quite complex, including the fusion of additional membranes carrying such proteins as ATG9 (which is missing from our enriched ERGIC membrane), as well as a substantial morphological transformation from a membrane sheet into a closed concentric membrane sphere. An alternative strategy could be to start with membranes from an Atg null cell line blocked at a distinctly later step in the pathway. We hope the reviewers will appreciate that this is beyond the scope of this paper, which we believe is already quite complex."

Instead, we performed confocal microscopy to analyze the colocalization of ERGIC with ATG14 and DFCP1, two early autophagy markers as indicated in the manuscript. We found that the starvation-induced puncta of ATG14 partially overlaps with ERGIC (Figure 12—figure supplement 2A). DFCP1, the autophagy-related PI3P binding protein, colocalizes with ERGIC shortly after starvation (Figure 12—figure supplement 2B). These data are consistent with our membrane recruitment assay in Figure 12. Together, the results suggest that ATG14 may transiently associate with ERGIC to generate PI3P, and subsequently be recognized by DFCP1 to initiate autophagosome biogenesis."

We also showed that tubulin, an abundant cytosolic protein, was barely recruited to the membrane. For the LC3-II recruitment, we took the reviewer’s suggestion and added the T7-tagged LC3-I in the in vitro recruitment reaction. We found that the lipidated T7-LC3 was recruited to the membrane fraction while the soluble form LC3-I was not. Moreover, depletion of ERGIC mitigated the generation of LC3-II as indicated by the reduced signal in the top membrane fraction (Figure 12)."

Nonetheless, in order for this paper to have the proper impact in the field and provide as useful a tool as possible for future researchers, we think that it is important to provide as much characterization as you can in the text of what your system is reconstituting in vitro. Accordingly, we would like you to mention (and discuss as you deem appropriate) the results of LC3-II protease protection experiments in the text. As you point out, the absence of complete reconstitution of a closed membrane sphere does not detract from the overall importance of your work; however, we feel that it is important for readers to know this limitation of your in vitro LC3 lipidation system."
