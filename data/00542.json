These proteins, through inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A, respectively, impair cap-dependent translation. Under stress conditions FOXO transcription factors activate 4E-BP expression amplifying the repression. Here we show that Drosophila FOXO binds the PDCD4 promoter and stimulates the transcription of PDCD4 in response to stress. We have shown previously that the 5′ UTR of the Drosophila insulin-like receptor (dINR) supports cap-independent translation that is resistant to 4E-BP. Using hippuristanol, an eIF4A inhibitor, we find that translation of dINR UTR containing transcripts are also resistant to eIF4A inhibition. In addition, the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptor 5′ UTRs support cap-independent translation and have a similar resistance to hippuristanol. This resistance to inhibition of eIF4E and eIF4A indicates a conserved strategy to allow translation of growth factor receptors under stress conditions."

This involves regulating the expression of the genes that code for these proteins."

      "content": "When cells experience stressful events, such as a shortage of oxygen or nutrients, they reduce the synthesis of most proteins. This response is regulated, in part, by a signaling pathway known as the insulin and insulin-like receptor pathway. In particular, stressful events inhibit a protein complex called eIF4F, which normally initiates the translation of mRNA molecules by binding to a structure on one end of the mRNA called the 5′ cap. Despite this general inhibition, the production of certain other proteins—including the insulin receptor itself—is actually increased in response to stress."

      "content": "Olson et al. have carried out a series of experiments to explore how inhibition of the eIF4F protein complex influences the translation of the mRNA for the insulin receptor. The eIF4F complex is made up of three proteins, including one that binds to the 5′ cap and a helicase that unwinds the RNA. Previous work in the fruit fly Drosophila showed that translation of this mRNA can continue even if formation of the eIF4F complex is inhibited by targeting the cap binding protein. Olsen et al. now show that translation of this mRNA is also independent of the helicase. Instead, translation is maintained under these conditions because the insulin receptor mRNA contains a sequence called an internal ribosome entry site, which allows ribosomes to bind to the mRNA without the influence of the 5′ cap."

Coordinate changes in both transcription and translation occur (Sengupta et al., 2010; Spriggs et al., 2010). A central pathway that responds to stress stimuli by controlling both protein and RNA synthesis is the insulin and insulin-like receptor-signaling (IIS) pathway. The fundamental molecular architecture of the IIS pathway is conserved from flies to man (Figure 1) (Oldham, 2011). When IIS signaling is high, the protein kinase AKT is activated (Ruggero and Sonenberg, 2005). AKT directly phosphorylates the Foxo family of transcription factors and consequently prevents activated transcription of Foxo target genes (Brunet et al., 1999). AKT also stimulates the activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein (Zoncu et al., 2011)."

S6K in turn inhibits Pdcd4 and activates eIF4B. When insulin signaling is low inhibition of Foxo is relieved and Foxo activates the transcription of Insulin receptor and 4E-BP. The broken line indicates the proposed activation of Pdcd4 by Foxo. (B) Alignment of human (Hs top) and Drosophila (Dm bottom) Pdcd4 proteins. Conserved Akt and S6K phosphorylation sites are indicated by asterisk. Conserved MA3 domains are indicated by shaded boxes. Arrowheads indicate conserved acidic residues important for eIF4A binding in humans. (C) eIF4A interacts with Pdcd4 in Drosophila cells. Cytoplasmic extracts from a saturated culture of S2 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against eIF4A or preimmune serum. Pdcd4 was detected with antisera against Pdcd4. (D) Mutant Pdcd4 binds less efficiently to eIF4A than wildtype. Cytoplasmic extracts from cultures of S2 cells expression wild-type Myc-Pdcd4 or mutant Myc-Pdcd4 (AA) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against eIF4A. Myc-Pdcd4 was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody to the Myc tag. Immunoprecipitated eIF4A was detected with rabbit antisera. (E) Immobilized Drosophila Pdcd4 interacts with Drosophila eIF4A. On the top is a cartoon of approach. On the bottom is an immnoblot of proteins eluted from the affinity columns. Position of the recombinant eIF4A is indicated."

The eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E, the 7-methyl-Guanosine-cap (m7G) binding protein, eIF4A, an RNA helicase, and eIF4G, a large scaffolding protein. In addition, the RNA binding protein eIF4B can associate with eIF4F to stimulate the helicase activity of eIF4A (Ma and Blenis, 2009; Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009; Zoncu et al., 2011). mTOR stimulates general translation in part by inactivating translational inhibitors. mTOR phosphorylates and inactivates the translation repressor eIF4E binding protein (4E-BP) (Gingras et al., 1999) allowing efficient formation of the eIF4F complex. In addition, mTOR activates ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) (Sarbassov et al., 2005). S6K stimulates the helicase eIF4A by activating eIF4B and inhibiting programmed cell death protein 4 (Pdcd4), a known eIF4A inhibitor (Figure 1) (Yang et al., 2003; Raught et al., 2004; Dorrello et al., 2006). Thus under conditions of high signaling through AKT and mTOR, cap-dependent translation is stimulated."

Foxo moves to the nucleus and controls the transcription of its target genes (Salih and Brunet, 2008). 4E-BP prevents formation of the translation initiation complex eIF4F, thereby inhibiting m7G-dependent translation, and S6K no longer stimulates eIF4A. This in turn leads to lower levels of global protein synthesis. Thus the IIS pathway controls gene expression with two different branches: transcription of Foxo target genes and m7G-cap-dependent translation through 4E-BP and S6K."

      "content": "Foxo activates the transcription of the Drosophila insulin receptor gene from three promoters. Each promoter produces a transcript with a distinct 5′ untranslated region (UTR) but identical coding region (Casas-Tinto et al., 2007; Marr et al., 2007). Transcripts derived from promoter 1 are by far the most abundant and ubiquitous form of INR transcript (Casas-Tinto et al., 2007; Marr et al., 2007). The Drosophila INR 5′ UTRs contain an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that allows the message to escape 4E-BP inhibition of cap-dependent translation. This mechanism provides a functional coupling of transcription and translation in times of stress that allows amplification of insulin receptor expression (Marr et al., 2007). Because IRES containing transcripts can outcompete cap-dependent transcripts under these conditions their translation is actually stimulated (Svitkin et al., 2005; Marr et al., 2007). This leads to an effective switch of the cellular translation machinery to targets of the IIS pathway. Thus, Foxo targets impose a translational program by activation of genes that repress general translation while simultaneously activating targets that are immune to this translational control. This provides these targets with a competitive advantage allowing them to utilize the translation machinery that is freed by the general inhibition. Here we identify Drosophila Pdcd4 as an additional Foxo target further enhancing the coupling of transcription and translation regulation in the IIS pathway."

To answer this question we used both an in vitro translation system and a cell based assay to investigate the eIF4A requirements for efficient translation of reporters containing the INR 5′ UTR from Drosophila. Because mammalian systems show the same type of regulation, we also investigated the role of eIF4A inhibition in the murine insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor receptors. (Giraud et al., 2001; Meng et al., 2008; Spriggs et al., 2009b). We find, in both the Drosophila and mouse systems, that the 5′ UTRs of the mRNAs for these receptors provide resistance to both eIF4E and eIF4A inhibition. Taken together, these results indicate that these cellular messages have some of the lowest requirement for eIF4F activity for translation identified to date."

Since the IIS pathway is also known to control eIF4A activity through Pdcd4 (Figure 1A), we tested if this gene is under direct Foxo control in Drosophila. Blast analysis of human Pdcd4 with the Drosophila genome identifies a single homologous protein encoded by CG10990. Alignment of human PDCD4 and CG10990 indicate that important regions of the protein are conserved (Figure 1B) (Cash and Andrews, 2012). The two MA3 domains, including the acidic residues shown to be important for the interaction with eIF4A are conserved (Chang et al., 2009; Waters et al., 2011). In addition, the Akt and S6K phosphorylation sites are conserved (Palamarchuk et al., 2005; Dorrello et al., 2006)."

Associated Pdcd4 was detected by immunoblot. Pdcd4 is co-precipitated with antisera against eIF4A but not with preimmune serum indicating that Pdcd4 and eIF4A interact in Drosophila cells (Figure 1C). We next created Myc-tagged expression constructs for Drosophila Pdcd4, one wildtype construct and a construct containing mutations in conserved residues in the first MA3 domain (E282A, D286A). The analogous mutations in human PDCD4 destabilize the interaction with eIF4A (Chang et al., 2009; Waters et al., 2011). The constructs were transfected into growing Drosophila S2 cells. Subsequent immunoprecipitation of eIF4A from these cells reveals a decreased association of the mutant Pdcd4 with eIF4A (Figure 1D). This indicates the mutations induce the same destabilization of the eIF4A–Pdcd4 interaction in Drosophila cells. Interestingly under these conditions we detect multiple forms of Pdcd4 by western blot, most likely phosphorylated forms of Pdcd4, and only the fastest migrating species associates with eIF4A."

In an effort to determine if Foxo binds to the Pdcd4 gene in nutrient stressed animals we reanalyzed the only publically available Foxo ChIP (Chromatin immunoprecipitation) dataset (Teleman et al., 2008). These experiments were performed on starved larva. We find Foxo binds the Pdcd4 gene in both the promoter and intronic regions with enrichment values as high as 16-fold over background (Figure 2A). To corroborate this finding, we performed ChIP on genomic DNA from a cell line with an inducible Foxo cDNA gene that has been modified so the Foxo protein produced is constitutively active because it is immune to the negative regulation by insulin signaling (FoxoCA) (Puig et al., 2003; Gershman et al., 2007). This allows us to induce Foxo under conditions of high nutrient signaling and remove possible crosstalk from upstream signaling pathways. We tested the enrichment of genomic sequences by qPCR using primers to the Pdcd4 promoter region (Figure 2A) compared to a region in the first intron of CG15414, a gene just downstream of 4E-BP. We find FoxoCA binds to the promoter region of Pdcd4 at levels comparable to a well-defined direct target, 4E-BP (Junger et al., 2003; Puig et al., 2003; Marr et al., 2007) (Figure 2B). To determine the effect on mRNA production under these conditions we performed quantitative RT-qPCR on induced cells. We find that the steady-state level of Pdcd4 mRNA is increased about threefold in cells expressing active Foxo (Figure 2C). To determine if the effect is due to mRNA stability changes or new transcription we assayed intron-containing pre-mRNAs by RT-qPCR. Since most splicing is co-transcriptional in Drosophila this is a good assay for new RNA synthesis (Khodor et al., 2011). We find that Pdcd4 pre-mRNA is increased, indicating an increase in transcription of the gene. The increased mRNA also leads to increased protein synthesis as determined by immuno-blot with antibodies directed against Drosophila Pdcd4 (Figure 2D). This is likely an underestimate of the effect since these experiments are all done under high serum and insulin conditions that should result in the rapid turnover of Pdcd4 protein (Dorrello et al., 2006)."

Adult wildtype or Foxo null flies (Slack et al., 2011) were treated with paraquat to induce oxidative stress and assayed for expression of 4E-BP, Pdcd4, and GstD1 by RT-qPCR. Consistent with previous results (Wang et al., 2005), 4E-BP is induced by paraquat in a Foxo dependent manner. Like 4E-BP, we find that Pdcd4 is induced in response to paraquat in a Foxo dependent manner (Figure 2E). To determine if the effect was due to loss of general oxidative stress response or if it is Foxo specific we examined the induction of GstD1, a gene controlled by Nrf2 in response to oxidative stress (Misra et al., 2011). We find that GstD1 is still responsive indicating that the effects at Pdcd4 and 4E-BP are Foxo-specific and not due to a loss of responsiveness in the mutant flies (Figure 2E). These results are consistent with the idea that in addition to controlling the cap-binding complex through 4E-BP, active Foxo can influence eIF4A through activation of the Pdcd4 gene in response to stress. Given that Foxo is activating transcription of the INR gene while Pdcd4 is also active, we hypothesized that since the INR mRNA is translated efficiently under these conditions (Marr et al., 2007) it must be at least partially immune to diminished eIF4A activity."

In this assay a construct is used that produces a RNA in which the open reading frames of renilla luciferase and firefly luciferase are present on the same transcript (Figure 3A). Renilla luciferase levels are an indication of total message produced in the cell and firefly luciferase levels are an indication of IRES dependent translation. As previously reported, insertion of the INR 5′ UTR between the ORFs promotes translation of the second ORF (Marr et al., 2007). The levels of IRES activity of the INR UTR are comparable to the well-characterized IRES from Hepatitis C Virus (Figure 3B) (Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992). The INR UTR and the HCV IRES both produce more firefly signal than the empty vector (Figure 3D)."

In order to more accurately determine the effects of the protein in question we modified the assay so the production of the dicistronic mRNA is inducible. This allows accumulation of the experimental protein in the cell before the dicistronic mRNA is produced giving a more precise measure of the effects on the activity of the dicistronic message. The levels of expression of the second ORF relative to the first ORF are an indication of the cap-independent translation potential of the insert. To validate this assay we reproduced our previous results with 4E-BP (Marr et al., 2007). As reported previously, expression of 4E-BP stimulates the translation of the second open reading frame in a reporter containing the INR 5′UTR (Figure 3E,G). Expression of Pdcd4 also stimulates translation of the second ORF dependent on the INR 5′UTR similar to the effects seen with the HCV IRES (Figure 3E,G). These effects are specific. Mutation of the key acidic residues (Figure 1B) in Pdcd4 shown to disrupt eIF4A binding in the human system (Waters et al., 2011) prevent the IRES stimulation."

Hippuristanol is a potent translation inhibitor that works in eukaryotes from yeast to human (Lindqvist et al., 2008). Hippuristanol inhibits the ATPase activity and RNA binding of eIF4A (Bordeleau et al., 2006; Lindqvist et al., 2008). The small molecule binds to the protein in conserved regions V and VI in eIF4A homologues (Lindqvist et al., 2008). Importantly, the effects on translation can be rescued by addition of either wild-type or mutant forms of eIF4A that are immune to hippuristanol indicating that the effects are highly specific for eIF4A (Bordeleau et al., 2006; Lindqvist et al., 2008). This small molecule had been used previously in the Drosophila system to investigate eIF4A requirements (Iwasaki et al., 2009)."

      "content": "We performed in vitro competitive translation experiments with capped and polyadenylated firefly luciferase reporters (Figure 4A) and a Drosophila embryo extract translation system that has not been treated with micrococcal nuclease (Gebauer et al., 1999; Marr et al., 2007) in the presence of hippuristanol. The RNA reporters contain the 5′ UTR from the Drosophila insulin receptor. In addition we include two control RNAs. One control RNA contains a non-specific UTR derived from plasmid sequences. The other RNA contains the IRES from the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Tsukiyama-Kohara et al., 1992). This IRES does not require eIF4A activity and controls for non-specific effects on the extract (Pestova et al., 1998). Under the experimental conditions, translation of the first control RNA is strongly inhibited by hippuristanol while the reporter containing the HCV IRES is completely resistant to eIF4A inhibition (Figure 4A). This small molecule inhibitor exposed a greatly diminished role for eIF4A in the Drosophila INR UTR mediated translation (Figure 4A). At the low and moderate concentrations of hippuristanol, the Drosophila INR UTR reporter retains almost complete activity comparable to the HCV UTR. Even at the highest concentration of hippuristanol tested, the reporter containing the INR UTR retains >50% of the original translation activity. To determine the effect of Pdcd4 in this system we added recombinant Pdcd4 to the translation extract. Consistent with the data using hippuristanol, we find Pdcd4 can inhibit the control RNA but not the Drosophila INR UTR or the HCV IRES (Figure 4B). These finding suggests that translation of the most abundant Drosophila INR transcript can tolerate inhibition of eIF4A."

Dicistronic RNAs were synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA was capped and polyadenylated and used to program the same Drosophila embryo translation system described above. The extracts were treated with either hippuristanol or carrier. Consistent with the monocistronic assay, both the INR and the HCV IRES containing transcripts show increased relative translation of the second ORF upon eIF4A inhibition (Figure 4C). The increase is due both to a resistance of the second ORF to the inhibition and a decrease in the cap-dependent translation of the first ORF (Figure 4D). Under these conditions there is a small amount of cryptic translation of the second ORF in the control transcript. However both the renilla and firefly activites respond the same to the hippuristanol treatment."

To address this, we cloned the 5′ UTR from the longest mRNAs for the mouse insulin receptor (mINR) and the mouse insulin-like growth factor receptor-I (IGFR) and created firefly luciferase reporters under the control of these UTRs (Figure 5A). Previously, it was reported that INR and IGFR UTRs confer cap-independent translation activity in human and rat (Giraud et al., 2001; Spriggs et al., 2009b). To extend this finding to the mouse system and ensure that our competitive rabbit reticulocyte system was capable of supporting cap-independent translation, we assayed translation of the mINR and IGFR reporters in the presence of excess m7G cap along with our control RNA and the HCV IRES reporters described above (Figure 5A). While the control RNA is inhibited by excess cap, translation from the 5′ UTR of mINR and IGFR is not only resistant to excess m7G cap but the activity actually increases in the presence of excess m7G cap. This observation is common with UTRs that contain an IRES (Svitkin et al., 2005). The increase in activity for both the mINR and IGFR UTRs exceeded the IRES activity of the HCV UTR. This indicates that mINR UTR and IGFR UTR are capable of conferring cap-independent translation initiation."

In fact, the HCV IRES is stimulated fourfold by addition of hippuristanol under these conditions. Both mINR and IGFR UTRs confer resistance to hippuristanol (Figure 5C). Even at the highest concentrations of the small molecule the mINR and mIGFR UTRs remain roughly 50% active indicating a decreased requirement for eIF4A relative to the control RNA."

Thus, under these conditions the eIF4F complex is repressed by two mechanisms.

First, we show that active Foxo is capable of directly stimulating the transcription of Pdcd4, analogous to the activation of 4E-BP seen previously under these same conditions (Junger et al., 2003; Puig et al., 2003). This provides a mechanism for the pathways controlling Foxo to enhance the inhibition of eIF4A when stressed or when nutrients are low. Second we show that the 5′ UTR of the most abundant Drosophila INR transcript provides resistance to eIF4A inhibition comparable to the resistance seen with the HCV IRES that does not require eIF4A. A similar finding has been seen for the Drosophila reaper 5′ UTR (Hernandez et al., 2004; Iwasaki et al., 2009)."

The mouse transcripts show resistance to hippuristanol under conditions that almost completely inhibit a control RNA indicating that the resistance to eIF4A inhibition is also conserved. There are no easily recognizable conserved sequence elements between the Drosophila and mouse UTRs, but the mode of regulation is conserved suggesting an important role for this type of translational control. This defines a functional characteristic of the insulin receptor and IGF receptor transcripts that is conserved across hundreds of millions of years of evolution (from flies to mammals)."

      "content": "Taken together with previous work, these data indicate that the coupling of transcription to translation of insulin receptor mRNA mediated by Foxo targets can culminate in an activated translational response. Our findings highlight a unique characteristic of the insulin receptor and IGF receptor UTRs that differentiates them from other cellular transcripts. In addition to being immune to 4E-BP, these IRESes are resistant to eIF4A inhibition. While viral IRESes are fairly common, cellular IRESes are rare and relatively unexplored. Where it has been explored, most cellular IRESes have a strong requirement for eIF4A (Thoma et al., 2004; Spriggs et al., 2009a). The INR and IGFR UTRs seem to require neither eIF4E nor eIF4A. In fact, these UTRs have the lowest identified requirement for eIF4F activity of any cellular transcript thus far. In addition, they are immune to two of the most important types of translational control, namely 4E-BP control and eIF4A inhibition. Both of these features make sense given the cellular environment when these mRNAs are to be translated. The conserved resistance to eIF4E and eIF4A inhibition of the insulin receptor transcripts should make them capable of out-competing other cellular transcripts with greater need for eIF4A or eIF4E. Using these exceptional characteristics, the insulin receptor mRNA could out-compete more abundant transcripts under times of stress or when nutrients are limiting and 4E-BP and Pdcd4 are active."

In more recent work other components of the pathway have been identified as transcriptionally controlled by Foxo. If these targets are to be translated when Foxo is active they should also require mechanisms to escape 4E-BP and Pdcd4 inhibition. It remains to be seen if they will use the same mechanism as the INR mRNA or another mechanism."

The IRES sequence from HCV (Kieft et al., 1999) was subcloned into the inducible expression vector. For expression in S2 cells, Pdcd4 was cloned under a minimal actin promoter. For the Pdcd4 double mutant construct, amino acids 282, and 286 (Figure 1B) were mutated to alanine by site directed mutagenesis. S2 cells were maintained in Schneider’s media with 10% FBS and Penicillin/Streptomycin. For transfection, cells were plated at 1.25×106 cells/ml in Schneider’s supplemented with 10% FBS and an additional 1 µg/ml bovine insulin. DNA was transfected at a 4:1 ratio expression plasmid to reporter plasmid using effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) following instructions for S2 cells. Cells were induced with 500 µM CuSO4 36 hr after transfection. Cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed 36 hr after induction using a dual luciferase assay.
