Human to mosquito transmission was assessed using 171 direct mosquito feeding assays conducted in Burkina Faso and Kenya. Plasmodium falciparum infects Anopheles gambiae efficiently at low densities (4% mosquitoes at 1/µl blood), although substantially more (>200/µl) are required to increase infection further. In a site in Burkina Faso, children harbour more gametocytes than adults though the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection means that (per person) they only contribute slightly more to transmission. This method can be used to determine the reservoir of infection in different endemic settings. Interventions reducing gametocyte density need to be highly effective in order to halt human–mosquito transmission, although their use can be optimised by targeting those contributing the most to transmission."

Moreover, the transmission rate remains relatively stable as the density increases, before increasing significantly when the density reaches around 200 cells per microlitre."

      "content": "The malaria parasite is transmitted among humans by anopheline mosquitoes. Male and female transmission stages (gametocytes) are ingested by the mosquito and reproduce sexually in its stomach before developing into oocysts. Once oocysts establish, it is assumed that mosquitoes will form infectious sporozoites, so the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts is used as a measure of mosquito infectivity. In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, mosquito infection is thought to increase with the number of gametocytes ingested by the mosquito (Jeffery and Eyles, 1955; Graves et al., 1988; Bousema and Drakeley, 2011). However, several studies have failed to find an association (Boudin et al., 1993; Haji et al., 1996), and the precise shape of the relationship has never been rigorously quantified, particularly at very low gametocyte densities. Difficulties arise because estimates of gametocyte density have relied on microscopy, which may miss up to 80% of parasites (Dowling and Shute, 1966). More sensitive molecular methods such as Pfs25mRNA quantitative nucleic acid sequence–based amplification (QT-NASBA) have been developed (Schneider et al., 2004). Unlike conventional microscopy, this technique enables gametocyte densities to be quantified over the entire epidemiologically relevant range."

A wide range of novel transmission-reducing drugs and vaccines are currently under development, which aim to reduce malaria incidence by restricting human to mosquito transmission. The transmission-reducing ability of front-line therapeutics (such as artemisinin-based combination therapies [ACTs], or potential combinations of ACTs with gametocytocidal drugs) is also gaining increased attention (WHO, 2012; White, 2013). It is likely that these interventions will be partially effective, but it remains unclear how much they need to reduce transmission from humans to mosquitoes in a particular location, and to which age groups they should be delivered in order to halt malaria transmission."

Greater complexity, however, will be required to capture fully malaria population dynamics following the introduction of drugs and vaccines that specifically target transmission stages. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently recommended that in pre-elimination or elimination malaria programmes, single-dose primaquine (0·25 mg base per kg) with an ACT should be given to all patients with falciparum malaria except pregnant women and infants <1 year old (WHO, 2012). More detailed mathematical models will allow the full impact of this change in strategy to be assessed in a range of different endemic settings."

      "content": "The relationship between the number of gametocytes in the blood and mosquito infection was found to be highly non-linear (Figure 1A). Plasmodium falciparum infects mosquitoes at the very low gametocyte densities that predominate in natural infections and may not be detected using standard microscopy (Bousema and Drakeley, 2011). Infection rises rapidly with increasing gametocyte density, and by 1 gametocyte per microlitre, ∼4% (95% Bayesian credible interval [CI], 3–5%) of all mosquitoes develop oocysts. The subsequent increase in infection with increasing gametocyte density is best described by the Gompertz model (deviance information criterion [DIC] = 1034), which gave a significantly better fit than the linear (DIC = 1073), power (DIC = 1059), or hyperbolic (DIC = 1062) functions (Figure 1A). The best-fit model predicts that increasing density from 1 to 200 gametocytes per microlitre does not appreciably increase infection. Beyond 200 gametocytes per microlitre, infection rises again to finally plateau at ∼18% infected mosquitoes. Gametocyte density on an arithmetic scale was a better predictor of mosquito infection than gametocyte density on a logarithmic scale. Including information on the host’s asexual parasite density significantly improved model fit. Children with asexual parasite densities between 1 and 1000 parasites per microlitre were on average 27% (CI, 19–58%) less infectious to mosquitoes than those with no detectable asexual parasites, whereas those with asexual densities >1000 µl−1 were 77% (CI, 14–140%) more infectious. Including age improves the fit of the model suggesting that age is an important confounder, although the Bayesian credible intervals include 0. Children >6 years old were 15% (CI, 24–64%) more likely to infect mosquitoes than those of younger ages, whereas no difference in the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection was detected between Burkina Faso and Kenya."

Point colour, shading, and shape denote characteristics of the blood donor, such as location (blue = Burkina Faso; red = Kenya), asexual parasite density as measured by microscopy (no fill colour = none detectable, light shading = 1–1000 parasites per microlitre, dark shading ≥1000 µl−1), or host age (<6 years old = square, ≥6 years old = circle). The size of the point is proportional to the number of mosquitoes dissected. Coloured horizontal and vertical lines indicate 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CIs) around point estimates. The solid black line indicates the best-fit model, whereas the grey shaded area indicates the uncertainty around this line. The inset shows the relationship at very low gametocyte densities (on a logarithmic scale). The outputs show the shape of the relationship for a child with no detectable asexual parasites. A full description of data used to fit the model are given in Figure 1—source data 1. Regression coefficients and a measure of goodness-of-fit of the different models are given in Figure 1—source data 2. Panel (B) shows how efficacious transmission-reducing interventions would need to be (on the vertical axis) at decreasing gametocyte density in order to reduce human to mosquito transmission (contour lines). The best-fit line from (A) is used to illustrate the percentage reduction in mosquito infection that would be achieved according to the pre-intervention host’s gametocyte density (on the horizontal axis) for an intervention, which reduces gametocyte density by a given percentage (which is assumed to be constant over different gametocyte densities). The colours represent the percentage reduction in mosquito infection that would be achieved, ranging from red (low, 0–10% reduction) to darker hues of blue (high, 70–80% and 80–90% reduction, see legend). The 90–100% reduction in transmission is hardly visible and would correspond to nearly 100% efficacious interventions at the top of the graph."

For example, reducing gametocyte density by 99% in a host with 200 gametocytes per microlitre may not have much effect on their immediate contribution to transmission (Figure 1B), although it will probably reduce the duration of infectivity. The same intervention efficacy at reducing gametocyte density in a host with 300 gametocytes per microlitre would cause an appreciable reduction in human to mosquito transmission from that individual. Figure 1B can be used to estimate how a reduction in the number of gametocytes will equate to a reduction in the proportion of mosquitoes becoming infected, and hence mosquito to human transmission. How this relates to the incidence of malaria and subsequent disease will depend, in part, on the degree of immunity in the human population."

The distribution of gametocytes among hosts is highly overdispersed. A full description of data used to fit the model are given in Figure 2—source data 1 with the best-fit parameter estimates shown in Figure 2—source data 2. The relationship between gametocyte density and oocyst prevalence shown in Figure 1A is used to predict the percentage of mosquitoes that will become infected after biting a host of a certain age. This is shown in panel (B), which can be interpreted as the contribution of each age group towards the human to mosquito transmission. In both figures, the black solid line shows the best-fit model and the grey shaded area indicates the uncertainty (95% Bayesian credible Interval, CI) having fitted the model to the individual data (a total of 412 individuals). For illustrative purposes, the data are grouped into seven bins, namely 0–5, 5–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, and ≥50 year olds, and the size of the point is proportional to the number of individuals in the group. In Figure 1A, the 10–15 and 15–20 year groups appear lower than the best-fit line due to sampling artefacts generated by the highly overdispersed data. Vertical lines indicate the 95% CI around grouped estimates."

      "content": "The complex shape of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection elucidated here will influence our understanding of the population dynamics of falciparum malaria and will determine the success of transmission-reducing interventions. The efficiency with which P. falciparum gametocytes can infect mosquitoes means that transmission-reducing interventions, which reduce gametocyte density, will need to be highly effective in order to reduce human–mosquito transmission. Gametocytes can infect mosquitoes at very low densities, despite the mosquito needing to ingest both male and female parasites in the same blood meal. Substantial transmission was seen from hosts with <1 gametocyte per microlitre of blood. After this initial increase in infection, considerably more gametocytes are required in order to increase further the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts. The causes of this are unclear, but experimental systems may be informative. Data from the rodent malaria model Plasmodium berghei (Sinden et al., 2007) suggest that the phenomenon could be associated with parasite mortality during penetration of the mosquito gut wall or due to the mosquito’s immune response. Beyond 200 gametocytes per microlitre mosquito infection rises again (although QT-NASBA measurement error makes the exact gametocyte density for this transition relatively uncertain). If an intervention can keep gametocyte density beneath 200 gametocytes per microlitre in a low transmission area, it may be sufficient to push the basic reproduction number of malaria beneath one and eliminate the disease. However, the highly overdispersed distribution of gametocytes between hosts (adequately described by the negative binomial distribution) means that in the population from Burkina Faso, 30% of transmission comes from hosts with densities beneath the microscopy detection threshold of 16 gametocytes per microlitre. This means that evaluating interventions solely on their ability to reduce microscopically detectable gametocytes, as has been suggested (Graves et al., 2012), may give misleading results."

It is unclear whether asexual parasites directly influence parasite infectivity or are associated with other (here unmeasured) variables such as the multiplicity of infection (Nsango et al., 2012) or factors influencing the blood environment such as immunity (Bousema and Drakeley, 2011). Plasmodium falciparum has asynchronous waves of asexual and sexual parasites. Circulating gametocytes take 2–3 days to mature before they can infect mosquitoes (Lensen et al., 1999), which may explain the complicated relationship between infectivity and asexual density (i.e., intermediate asexual parasite densities might occur at the start of gametocyte production and have a relatively low proportion of infectious mature gametocytes). On average, older children were more infectious, supporting previous indications that transmission-reducing immunity may predominate in young children (Drakeley et al., 2006)."

Molecular techniques may be highly precise in a state-of-the-art laboratory, but the practicalities of collecting and processing samples in non-ideal field settings increases the risks of incurring measurement error. Even though uncertainty is generally accepted by those conducting the experiments, measures of precision such as confidence intervals or standard errors around such density estimates are rarely reported in the scientific literature. Methods such as those presented in this article can allow robust quantitative insight to be gained from uncertain molecular methods. Care should be taken when interpreting gametocyte density estimates as it has been suggested that the marker used in this analysis (Pfs25 mRNA) might be parasite female specific (Schneider, 2006). Even if the current QT-NASBA method does only detect female gametocytes, it will neither change the qualitative conclusions of this study nor their application if other studies use the same technique. However, direct comparison of our results with those of studies using different methods for quantifying gametocyte density should be aware that the shape of the relationship may differ."

The proportion of mosquitoes infected by Plasmodium-infected blood is known to vary substantially within and between studies. This is in part due to methodological issues with the membrane feeding assay (Bousema et al., 2013) but also related to biological differences in the parasite-vector combination and the blood environment (Bousema and Drakeley, 2011). Further standardising the membrane feeding assay, improving the accuracy of QT-NASBA technique and the inclusion of additional covariates (such as estimates of gametocyte maturity, which have been investigated in Plasmodium vivax; Chansamut et al., 2012), would improve the accuracy of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection. It would also permit the patterns described here to be checked for consistency across time and space, and enable a wider range of functional forms to be tested. Care should also be taken when interpreting the results of feeding assays as the mosquitoes used, and their biting behaviour is likely to be different from that seen in wild mosquitoes in field situations (Bousema et al., 2013)."

      "content": "Transmission reduction will become increasingly important as areas approach local elimination. Identifying host age groups that contribute most to the reservoir of infection will allow the optimal targeting of malaria control. In the high transmission site in Burkina Faso, young children harbour the majority of gametocytes but are only slightly more infective to mosquitoes than adults. The per person contribution of adults estimated here is considerably greater than that predicted by other mathematical models (Ross et al., 2006) and may increase further once age-dependent biting rates are taken into consideration (Carnevale et al., 1978; Ross et al., 2006). The contribution of different age groups to overall transmission will depend on local demography, age-dependent protection by malaria interventions (such as the use of bed nets or time spent in the house and therefore personally protected by indoor residual spraying), and human to mosquito contact patterns. The last two of these are difficult to measure and poorly understood, reducing our ability to accurately predict the sources of infection. The reservoir of infection is likely to vary between endemicity settings and over time so multiple cross-sectional surveys may be required. The relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection will allow estimates of the reservoir of infection from cross-sectional gametocytaemia surveys without the need for logistically complicated mosquito feeding assays. The results of this article should be included within mathematical models that capture changes in gametocyte density with time (Lawpoolsri et al., 2009) to evaluate the full impact that different transmission-reducing interventions will have on transmission and prioritise the most appropriate candidates according to transmission setting."

It shows that, given the ability of very low P. falciparum gametocyte densities to establish infection in A. gambiae, transmission-reducing interventions will need to be highly efficacious at reducing gametocyte density in order to halt human to mosquito transmission. The complex and non-linear shape of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection may explain why the ability of an interventions to reduce the proportion of infected mosquitoes has been shown to depend on the parasite load of the host (Churcher et al., 2012). Gametocyte density also changes with host age so the effectiveness of transmission-reducing interventions that target gametocytes will also vary with age. This should be considered in clinical trials of transmission-reducing candidate drugs and vaccines. The highly overdispersed distribution of gametocytes in the host population and the non-linear relationship between gametocytes/asexual parasite density and mosquito infection means that the impact of different transmission-reducing interventions on overall transmission at the population level will be far from intuitive."

A number of different methods have been used to do this (see Hoadley, 1970 and Hunter and Lamboy, 1981 and for discussion see Osborne, 1991), each of which has a different method for dealing with the problem of high β^1 values (i.e., a gentle gradient, which when used in equation 2 can generate infinitely large confidence interval estimates). Here, we use the most parsimonious approach that does not require assignment of previous distributions to (the unknown) gametocyte densities. Rather, uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients of equation 1 is propagated numerically via equation 2 to yield uncertainty in the estimated gametocyte densities. Since all the calibration line data have a relatively steep gradient, the difference between the different methods will be relatively minor, and all will generate sensibly tight confidence interval estimates.x^′, on the logarithmic scale. Estimates on the arithmetic scale are generated by taking the exponent, that is x′^=exp(lnx^′). These estimates are used in the functions below to determine the relationship between gametocyte density and the proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts."

Data from 171 mosquito feeds on patients’ blood conducted in Burkina Faso (Ouédraogo et al., 2009) and Kenya (Schneider et al., 2007) were combined and used to fit a quantitative relationship between gametocyte density, asexual parasite density, host age, and mosquito infection (proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts). A full description of these data is given in Figure 1—source data 1. Gametocyte density was quantified using QT-NASBA, and the uncertainty in the density estimates (the intra-assay variability) was quantified by fitting a hierarchical model to the 16 independent dilution series. In the Burkina Faso dataset, multiple assays were carried out on the same blood sample (an average of 2.63 assays per unknown blood sample). The mean gametocyte density from these multiple assays was taken to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The precise shape of the relationship was determined by fitting a range of different functional forms (a modified constant, linear, power, hyperbolic, sigmoid, and Gompertz functions) to data presented in Figure 1—source data 1 and statistically determining which gave the best fit. The proportion of mosquitoes developing oocysts, denoted by g, can be described by equation 3"

Asexual parasite density (estimated by microscopy) was categorized as being either undetectable (z1 = 0), low (<1000 parasites per microlitre of blood, z1 = 1) or high (≥1000 parasites per microlitre of blood, z1 = 2). Hosts were classified into two different age categories (<6 years [children, z2 = 0] or ≥ 6 yr [older children, z2 = 1). Mosquito infection was allowed to vary between Burkina Faso and Kenya (z3 = 0 for Burkina Faso, z3 = 1 for Kenya). The function ϕ(x^′,η) determines the shape of the relationship at very low gametocyte densities and is motivated by the observation that the malaria parasite can adjust its sex ratio to optimise transmission (Reece et al., 2008). Evidence indicates that transmission is possible even at very low gametocyte densities (Schneider et al., 2007; Ouédraogo et al., 2009), so ϕ(x^′,η) allows infection to rise very quickly with increasing gametocyte density at a rate determined by parameter η,"

This was done using the cross-sectional data from Burkina Faso to generate a proxy for the human reservoir of infection at this specific time in this location (although it does not take into account how vector biting rate may vary with host age). It is important to use individual host estimates of gametocyte density instead of mean estimates as the high degree of gametocyte overdispersion among hosts may accentuate the non-linear relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infection. For each of the 412 hosts, point estimates were obtained of the percentage of feeding mosquitoes (taking a single full blood meal) that would develop oocysts according to the age and the gametocyte/asexual parasite density of the host (equation 3). Equation 5 was used to fit a relationship between host age and their contribution towards human to mosquito transmission. This best-fit line was used to predict the percentage of overall transmission that originated from hosts who had gametocyte density estimates below the detection threshold of microscopy. Here, we define the detection threshold as the minimum (positive) density that can be estimated by sampling a certain volume of blood. It is assumed that gametocytes are counted against 500 white blood cells (WBC) and that there are on average 8000 WBC per µl of blood. This gives an average detection threshold of 16 gametocytes per microlitre of blood. This is a conservative estimate of the threshold density since densities above this value may still give false negative results both due reading errors or random sampling of gametocytes on the microscope slide."

This approach allows the uncertainties in the assessments of gametocyte density and mosquito infection rates (generated by different numbers of mosquitoes being dissected) to be taken into consideration, propagated into parameter posterior distributions. All parameters were assigned uninformative priors and were run until convergence was reached using standard methodology (Gelman and Rubin, 1996). The most parsimonious models were selected by comparing deviance information criteria (DIC) values (the lowest value giving the most parsimonious yet adequate fit) (Spiegelhalter et al., 2002). Uncertainly around the best-fit line is indicated by showing the 95% range of 10,000 runs randomly sampled from the posterior distribution. The distribution of gametocytes between hosts was highly overdispersed, with an aggregation parameter of the negative binomial distribution of 0.185 (95% Bayesian credible interval [CI], 0.16–0.21).Additional information"

The majority of the controversy stems from when the gradient of the calibration line is very small (i.e., a small difference in TTP spans the whole range of gametocyte densities). This is not the case for our QT-NASBA results where the gradient is sufficiently large and no appreciable differences in the results are observed irrespective of the method used.

Here we use the most parsimonious approach that does not require assignment of prior distributions to (the unknown) gametocyte densities. Rather, uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients of equation A1 is propagated numerically via equation A2 to yield uncertainty in the estimated gametocyte densities. Since each of the calibration lines have a relatively steep gradient the difference between the different methods will be relatively minor and all will generate sensibly tight confidence interval estimates.”"

However, we would suggest that in such a situation the number of female gametocytes would be a better prediction of infectivity than total gametocytes as each male gametocyte can fertilise up to 7 female gametocytes and the sex ratio will likely change to maximise female fertilization. Therefore, female gametocyte density represents the maximum potential infectivity."

If the reviewers meant to validate the QT-NASBA against another highly accurate method of determining gametocyte density, then we agree that this is a necessary process for us to have full confidence in the technique and our method of correcting for its uncertainty. However, we feel that our dilution procedure (whereby a gametocyte sample is diluted 5 times and each generates a TTP) provides a strong validation procedure within the model. In this example the fit of the calibration line to these dilutions is relatively poor, which is the reason behind the uncertainty round the individual gametocyte density estimates being so high. We are in the process of refining the nucleic acid extraction and amplification technique and we are generating increasingly precise QT-NASBA estimates, as validated by the dilution procedure. Since this has been done on samples not related to the current study we feel that including these here would confuse the message. If the reviewers are suggesting that we repeat the experiment with a different dataset then we do agree, and we have highlighted this in the text. However, to our knowledge no dataset currently exists."

The first hump is a necessity for the line to go through point 0,0 (which it has to do as zero gametocytes cannot generate any oocysts) since ∼4% of mosquitoes are infected at very low gametocyte densities. The second hump is less certain since there are relatively few data points at very high gametocyte densities. There is evidence of a second plateau in these data using differently shaped functions, which is why the power and hyperbolic functions give better fits than the linear function. This is also consistent with what has been observed in animal models (see Sinden et al. 2009). That said, we agree that the functions chosen might influence the shape and that it could be more complicated than shown here."

It also allows more accurate predictions of mosquito infectivity from cross-sectional surveys where these covariates are collected (such as in Burkina Faso). Since asexual parasite density and age are routinely collected we felt that the extra complexity of the model was warranted. We thank the reviewers for bringing this to our attention and we have changed the end of the Introduction accordingly to stress the rationale for doing so: “Other covariates that may influence infectivity such as asexual parasite density (measured by microscopy) and host age were also included to increase the ability of the model to predict human to mosquito transmission.”"

The mean gametocyte density from these multiple assays was taken to increase the accuracy of the estimates. The precise shape of the relationship was determined by fitting a range of different functional forms (a modified constant, linear, power, hyperbolic, sigmoid and Gompertz functions) and statistically determining which gave the best fit (a full description of the model is given in the Supplementary files). The model quantifying the uncertainty in gametocyte density estimates was fitted at the same time as the regression determining the relationship between gametocyte density (and other covariates) and the proportion of mosquitoes infected using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.

Neither of these data points have particularly large sample sizes, which increases the probability of this happening. This overdispersion is taken into account in the fitting process and though other methods of central tendency could be presented in the figure (such as the geometric mean or median), since the model is showing the arithmetic mean we felt this was the best comparison.

The infectivity of mosquitoes to Plasmodium infected blood is known to vary substantially within and between studies. This is in part due to methodological issues with the membrane feeding assay (Bousema, Churcher, Morlais, & Dinglasan, 2013) but also related to biological differences in the parasite-vector combination and the blood environment (Bousema & Drakeley, 2011). Further standardising the membrane feeding assay, improving the accuracy of QT-NASBA technique and the inclusion of additional covariates (such as estimates of gametocyte maturity which have been investigated in P. vivax (Chansamut et al., 2012)) would improve the accuracy of the relationship between gametocyte density and mosquito infectivity. It would also permit to see if the patterns described here are consistent across time and space, and enable a wider range of functional forms to be tested. Care should also be taken when interpreting the results of feeding assays as the mosquitoes used and their biting behaviour is likely to be different from that seen in wild mosquitoes in field situations (Bousema et al., 2013).”"

Since this is not the topic of this manuscript, we concentrate our answers on the reservoir of infection (i.e., transmission, not necessarily incidence of malaria). We have augmented the following section of the Discussion to reflect our opinions on the subject:"

The last two of these are difficult to measure and poorly understood, reducing our ability to predict accurately the sources of infection. The reservoir of infection is likely to vary between endemicity settings and over time so multiple cross-sectional surveys may be required.”"
