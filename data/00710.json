      "content": "In Huntington’s disease, a mutated version of the huntingtin protein leads to cell death. Mutant huntingtin is known to aggregate, a process that can be inhibited by the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (TCP1-ring complex) in vitro and in vivo. A structural understanding of the genesis of aggregates and their modulation by cellular chaperones could facilitate the development of therapies but has been hindered by the heterogeneity of amyloid aggregates. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and single particle cryo-electron tomography (SPT) we characterize the growth of fibrillar aggregates of mutant huntingtin exon 1 containing an expanded polyglutamine tract with 51 residues (mhttQ51), and resolve 3-D structures of the chaperonin TRiC interacting with mhttQ51. We find that TRiC caps mhttQ51 fibril tips via the apical domains of its subunits, and also encapsulates smaller mhtt oligomers within its chamber. These two complementary mechanisms provide a structural description for TRiC’s inhibition of mhttQ51 aggregation in vitro."

The disease is caused by a mutation in the huntingtin gene, which codes for the huntingtin protein, and all individuals who inherit a pathogenic form of the mutant gene will eventually develop the condition."

The number of repeats varies between individuals but if it exceeds 36, the huntingtin protein starts to form aggregates in the brain. Aggregation occurs when soluble protein precursors, known as oligomers, combine to form structures called fibrils, which in turn assemble into larger clusters. This phenomenon also occurs in several other tri-nucleotide diseases, each of which involves a mutated gene with an excess of tri-nucleotide repeats."

A chaperone protein known as TRiC, which interacts with approximately 10% of proteins in the cytosol, has been shown to inhibit the aggregation of mutant huntingtin proteins. However, it has not been possible to map the structural interactions between TRiC and huntingtin to date."

By imaging this system at different time points during the aggregation of mutant huntingtin, it was possible to characterize how the aggregates changed over time. They found that their shape differs in the presence and absence of TRiC, and that the chaperone interacts both with soluble huntingtin molecules—sequestering them so that they cannot join together—and with the tips of fibrils, preventing them from growing longer."

      "content": "The presence of huntingtin aggregates in the brain correlates strongly with functional deficits in individuals with Huntington’s disease (HD) (DiFiglia et al., 1997). These aggregates originate from a mutation in the huntingtin gene that causes an expansion of glutamine (Q) repeats in the huntingtin protein (Zoghbi and Orr, 2009). This polyglutamine expansion (Q>36) contributes to mutant huntingtin’s (mhtt) tendency to aggregate within the cell (Nekooki-Machida et al., 2009). Variants of mhtt exon1 containing an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) tract greater than 36 residues are commonly used as models to investigate mutant huntingtin’s properties in vitro and in vivo. Understanding how polyQ aggregation is modulated by cellular factors, including molecular chaperones, might lead to therapeutic strategies to treat polyQ pathogenesis. Some chaperones, such as the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC, are key regulators of protein aggregation (Muchowski and Wacker, 2005; Liebman and Meredith, 2010; Voisine et al., 2010). In fact, TRiC modulates and suppresses polyglutamine aggregation, including that of mhtt variants having polyQ tracts of different length. TRiCs inhibition of mhtt aggregation has been biochemically characterized for several variants both in vitro and in vivo (Kitamura et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2006)."

TRiC can assume different conformations in different biochemical states (Cong et al., 2012) and can bind substrates like actin and tubulin through different sites, either at its apical tips, which are conformationally flexible in the apo state (Llorca et al., 1999), or inside the chamber (Dekker et al., 2011; Muñoz et al., 2011). TRiC’s interactions with polyQ aggregates are also likely to be variable, as seen with other chaperone/substrate complexes (Kim et al., 2002)."

However, cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) can preserve specimens in close-to-solution conformations because the samples remain frozen-hydrated without chemical fixation or staining during the entire microscopy session (Dubochet et al., 1988). Additionally, cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) allows for visualization of entire protein aggregates in 3-D. Furthermore, 3-D subtomogram processing approaches (Walz et al., 1997; Böhm et al., 2000; Bartesaghi et al., 2008; Förster et al., 2008; Schmid and Booth, 2008), also known as single particle tomography (SPT), have facilitated the determination of the structure of heterogeneous specimens by classifying and averaging subvolumes containing a 3-D view of individual macromolecular complexes, potentially with different conformations and compositions. Indeed, SPT is an emerging technique in structural biology that can resolve the structure of heterogeneous macromolecular complexes at nanometer resolution."

Amongst the mhtt variants whose susceptibility to TRiC has been previously characterized in vitro and in vivo (Behrends et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2006), our choice of the mhttQ51 variant was guided by the fact that mutations yielding a polyQ tract longer than ∼58Q are rare in patients (Myers, 2004), and N-terminal fragments of similar length (Q53) have been isolated from brain tissue (Lunkes et al., 2002). We do not observe any regular repeat in the images of the aggregates, in contrast to more ordered aggregates such as beta amyloid and alpha synuclein (Lührs et al., 2005; Trexler and Rhoades, 2010). The heterogeneity of mhttQ51 fibrils precluded us from resolving their structure in detail since all current structural techniques require some underlying homogeneity in fibrillar structures to achieve high resolution."

By a process that is not yet fully understood, thin fibrils progress to form thicker fibers, and eventually form branched-out aggregates or ‘sheaves’ with a dense central core by 4 hr PIA (Figure 1B). At longer incubation times, we observe a dramatic increase in the number and thickness of such sheaves, characterized as large fiber bundles densely packed in their central regions and splayed out at both ends. The number of sheaves and their thickness appears to plateau at 24 hr PIA (Figure 1C)."

At 4 hr and 24 hr PIA (Figure 1E,F), sparse fibrils and a few small sheaves are present, but there are no aggregates as large as those seen in the absence of TRiC at the same time points (Figure 1B,C). TRiC does not completely decorate mhttQ51 fibrils, but rather binds at discrete locations, which are often discernible fibril tips (Figure 1G–H). In a 2-D cryoEM image, the entire volume of the actual specimen is projected onto a plane; therefore, some TRiCs seemingly close to a fibril in 2-D might be floating above or below it and not bound at all. Since 2-D cryoEM images cannot unambiguously show whether TRiC is directly bound to mhttQ5, we performed cryoET experiments."

We also reconstructed tilt series of TRiC in the absence of mhttQ51 as a control. Figure 2A is a slice extracted from one of our mhtt + TRiC tomograms, low-pass filtered for visualization. Figure 2B is a re-projection of the entire tomogram (Video 1) and Figure 2C a manual 3-D annotation of its features, which shows an aggregate of mhttQ51 fibrils in yellow, freestanding TRiC particles in blue, and putatively fibril-bound TRiCs in magenta. As in our 2-D images, our 3-D tomograms also show that TRiC does not fully decorate mhtt fibrils, but rather seems to bind at discrete locations, which often are discernible fibril tips. Our visual estimates from these 3-D tomograms indicate that 37% (120 of 326) of fibril-bound TRiCs locate to obvious and clearly discernible tips. Conversely, about half of the distinguishable fibril tips seem clearly capped by TRiC, but many tips (capped or uncapped) might be obscured by the dense tangles, or may exist as short stubs budding from the side of thicker fibers, which might not be discernible. In fact, given the low signal to noise ratio (S/N) of individual tomograms, their inherently anisotropic resolution, and ‘missing wedge’ distortions present in all cryoET data, it is challenging to visually discern all TRiC molecules and mhtt fibril tips that might be present in our crowded fibrillar tangles. In addition, some fibril-bound TRiCs might be bound to fibril tips barely ‘budding out’ from the sides of fibril bundles, too short to be discerned. Therefore, the number of TRiCs that locate to tips is likely to be underestimated when counting only those that are on visually discernible tips."

We processed a total of 326 fibril-bound TRiC subvolumes extracted from our tomograms using a completely bias-free subvolume alignment and averaging strategy (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Single particle tomography [SPT]’). This represented about one quarter of 1216 TRiC subvolumes extracted from all our mhtt-TRiC tomograms combined. Figure 3 shows examples of fibril-bound TRiC averages using subvolumes from separate tomograms. Although the heterogeneity of our fibril-bound TRiC sets precluded them from converging to a single structure and thwarted the determination of specific binding sites between TRiC and mhttQ51 fibrils, all our datasets yielded consistent barrel-shaped averages clearly resembling TRiC, with extra mass at the ends of the barrel. These extra densities are attributable to conformational averages of heterogeneous mhttQ51 fibrils. A few averages suggest a mode in which the fibrils might bind predominantly to the tip of a single CCT subunit, while others show mass splayed across the ring, making additional contacts."

These were about three quarters of the 1216 TRiC subvolumes extracted from all our mhtt-TRiC tomograms combined.

Our statistical analyses (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Criteria to discriminate between cavity-empty and cavity-occupied freestanding TRIC’, Figure 4) suggest that, while the freestanding TRiC subvolumes exhibit a high but continuous level of variability (Figure 4A), they can be divided into two statistically separable populations (Figure 4B).

This threshold is appropriate when the two maps are being compared, but not averaged, as a 0.5 threshold is appropriate when a map is being compared to a high-resolution reference (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003). Comparing the maps to the published apo-TRiC structure (Cong et al., 2012) using the FSC = 0.5 cutoff (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Assessment of the quality of bias-free freestanding TRiC averages’; Figure 7), yields similar values, ∼48 Å and ∼46 Å for cavity-occupied and cavity-empty TRiC respectively."

The interior mass is clearly seen in a difference map between the cavity-empty and the cavity-occupied averages (Figure 8B). Of note, the template was completely hollow, and therefore model bias cannot account for the extra density we see inside. The TRiC part of this cavity-occupied average is also pseudo eightfold symmetric (Figure 8A) and the dip in the rotational correlation plot (or ‘u-shaped’ path of the overall curves) can be explained by the presence of internal mass, localized to one side of the cavity when viewed end-on (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Localization of density within cavity-occupied TRiC SPT average’, ‘Estimation of the size of mhttQ51 oligomers encapsulated by TRiC’)."

Our aggregation and suppression of aggregation reactions followed well characterized conditions, previously described using filter trap assays that detect mhttQ51 amyloid aggregates (Tam et al., 2006). The mhtt concentration in our experiments was chosen to allow mhtt aggregation to occur in a reasonably short time in the absence of TRiC (Scherzinger et al., 1999), and the ratio of TRiC to mhtt was chosen to yield initial-stage fibril aggregates and yet thwart large-aggregate growth (Behrends et al., 2006). It is worth noting however that the TRiC:mhtt ratio under normal physiological conditions has not been carefully explored. Nonetheless, increasing cellular levels of TRiC has a beneficial effect in suppressing mhtt toxicity and aggregation (Behrends et al., 2006; Kitamura et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2006)."

TRiC is known to bind hydrophobic motifs via its apical substrate-binding domains (Spiess et al., 2006), and has also been shown to crosslink with the N-terminal N17 motif of mhtt, which drives mhtt oligomerization (Tam et al., 2009). It is therefore likely that the binding we demonstrate here between mhttQ51 fibrils and TRiC (Figures 1–3), which thwarts the progression of fibers into sheaves, may involve mhttQ51 hydrophobic moieties that include the N17 domain. Interestingly, this domain has been proposed to function as a ‘molecular switch’ (Greiner and Yang, 2011) controlled by multiple post-translational modifications that can determine the fate of mhtt exon-1 either by rendering it innocuous or enhancing its pathogenicity. By virtue of its interaction with the N17 domain, TRiC might provide a protective effect against deleterious post-translational modifications."

On the other hand, internalization of smaller mhttQ51 oligomers would also contribute to inhibition of sheaf formation by decreasing the effective concentration of oligomers in the reaction mixture. Our freestanding TRiC averages, free from template and symmetry bias (Figure 5), reveal a subpopulation with extra density inside the chaperonin’s cavity. Although other substrates have also been shown to bind deep inside the cavity of apo-TRiC (Muñoz et al., 2011), the finding that mhtt exon-1 might also be encapsulated is unprecedented. While it is conceivable for native substrates to be copurified with apo-TRiC, their presence within the chaperonin’s cavity is rare. For instance, our controls show that extra density is only detectable in ∼10% of the particles in the absence of added mhtt. On the other hand, we see significant extra density in ∼40–50% of the freestanding TRiC particles from our TRiC + mhtt tomograms. Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that TRiC does not bind GST (Feldman et al., 2003). Therefore, it is unlikely that either native substrates or the GST moiety that is cleaved from mhttQ51 to initiate aggregation could account for the internalized mass we observe (Figures 5B and 8). Rather, this density likely represents mhtt."

However, our estimates suggest an average size of ∼60 kDa (‘Materials and methods’ under ‘Estimation of the size of mhttQ51 oligomers encapsulated by TRiC’), which would correspond to an oligomer of about six mhttQ51 exon1 monomers. The mhttQ51 oligomers that might be encapsulated by TRiC could be analogous to precursor forms of the 100–230 kDa toxic oligomers previously reported (Behrends et al., 2006). Furthermore, it is possible that the extra density we see inside TRiC (Figures 5B and 8) corresponds to an average of encapsulated mhtt oligomers of different sizes and conformations."

The compositional and conformational heterogeneity of such a specimen precludes resolving nanometer resolution structures from it with any technique in structural biology other than SPT. Indeed, our approach demonstrates TRiC’s association with mhttQ51 fibrillar aggregates, and our results suggest TRiC might also sequester small mhttQ51 oligomers to effectively inhibit mhtt aggregation (Figure 9, Video 1). This novel mechanism contrasts with those typically proposed for the action of chaperones in suppressing aggregation of misfolded proteins (Hendrick and Hartl, 1995; Young et al., 2004) by binding monomeric forms. However, since our analysis lacks the sensitivity to distinguish TRiCs that might be bound to one mhtt monomer only, we cannot rule out that such a binding mode may co-exist with the ones presented here."

The suggestion that TRiC might cap fibril growth as well as internalize smaller oligomers indicates a broad scope for this chaperonin’s action on protein aggregates. The ability of TRiC to recognize and handle both types of proposed mhtt toxic species observed in Huntington’s disease (DiFiglia et al., 1997; Arrasate and Finkbeiner, 2011; Nucifora et al., 2012), namely oligomers and fibrillar aggregates, could account for the reduced toxicity of mhtQ51 and other mhtt species when TRiC is overexpressed in cells (Behrends et al., 2006; Tam et al., 2006). TRiC’s interaction with mhtt aggregates might render them more amenable to processing by cellular pathways of quality control, such as autophagy and proteolytic degradation by the proteasome (Sarkar et al., 2009)."

Our bias-free subtomogram processing uses unsupervised hierarchical ascendant classification and averaging (HAC), a technique involving pairwise alignment of sub-tomograms and clustering based on similarity (Bartesaghi et al., 2008; Förster et al., 2008; Schmid and Booth, 2008), without the aid of a reference and without imposing symmetry at any point. For fibril-bound TRiC, we visually inspected the new averages generated in each iteration to find representative examples of structures with extra density at the ends of the chaperonin (Figure 3). For each freestanding TRiC population (cavity-empty and cavity-occupied) as well as control TRiCs, we allowed HAC to converge to one final average of all the particles (Figure 5A,B). We noticed significant but poorly localized extra density inside the chamber of the cavity-occupied population."

To discriminate between cavity-empty and cavity-occupied TRiC, we divided the ranked subtomograms into quintiles (subsets of 178) and averaged the particles in each quintile. The average from each of the two highest quintiles had an empty cavity, while the cavity for each average from the two lowest quintiles contained a large density. The average from the middle quintile was neither clearly empty nor significantly occupied; therefore, we did not subject those subtomograms to further analysis. We made a final cavity-empty set from the two top quintiles and a final cavity-occupied set from the two bottom quintiles, each with 356 subtomograms. That is, each freestanding set (cavity-empty and cavity-occupied) was comprised of 40% of all freestanding TRiCs. In the context of all TRiC subvolumes extracted, each of these sets represented about one third of all particles picked (i.e., 356 of 1216)."

The displacement between the histograms using mask B is also statistically significant beyond a 99.9% confidence interval (CI), and the difference is much larger according to the t-value. This means that the difference between the particles in each group is very large when only the cavity is considered. Lastly, there was no significant displacement between the histograms using mask C, as confirmed by its low t-value, far below the 95% CI value. This means that when the cavity is excluded, the particles in each group are not significantly different.

We assessed the resolution of the cavity-empty structure as 46 Å by computing an FSC with the apo-TRiC map (Cong et al., 2012) using the FSC = 0.5 threshold, as is appropriate when comparing a map to a much higher resolution structure, as formulated previously (Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003) (Figure 7)."

Therefore, we applied a hollow-template-guided approach to further localize the inner mass within the chamber of the cavity-occupied TRiC average. This consisted of aligning the raw cavity-occupied TRiCs to a hollow D8 symmetric apo-TRiC reference (Booth et al., 2008) to generate an initial average. We then seeded iterative refinement of the raw subtomograms using this initial average. During all the iterations, the particles were masked to include only the cavity and were allowed only to visit D8 related orientations. Since the first round of alignment was against the D8 reference, restricting subsequent iterations to visit D8-related positions preserved the initial alignment of the particles against the reference while allowing the internal density to converge within the frame of TRiC after 17 iterations. While this procedure localized the internalized density in our cavity-occupied average, it had little effect on the cavity of the cavity-empty set. Of note, the ‘dip’ in the overall shape of the rotational correlation plot for the cavity-occupied average with the localized density can be explained by the presence of a large mass inside (Figure 8A). Applying the same classification and processing strategy to fibril-bound and control TRiCs as applied to freestanding TRiC did not yield any averages with comparable density inside the cavity."

First, we applied a mask to our final cavity-empty average (Figure 5A) that included the TRiC density only, thus excluding the cavity. We calculated the mean density inside this mask and multiplied this value by the volume of the mask. This yielded the final total mass of TRiC (without the cavity) in arbitrary units. Then we applied a mask to the difference map between the final cavity-empty average (Figure 5A) and the final cavity-occupied average (Figure 8A) that would include the region of the cavity only. We also computed the total mass within this mask, in arbitrary units. Using the actual mass of TRiC (∼950 kDa) to scale the masses in arbitrary units, we estimated the mass of the density in the cavity to be ∼55 kDa."

These histograms correspond to the density distribution of TRiC particles when the cavity is excluded, and therefore the average value in arbitrary units is proportional to TRiC’s mass. On the other hand, the histograms in Figure 4B(ii) correspond to the density distribution within the cavity of TRiC particles. The average density of the histogram from the cavity-empty group (blue) was considered to be ‘background’, in arbitrary units. Therefore, we subtracted this value from the average of the cavity-occupied histogram (green). This final value for average density in the cavity region in arbitrary units should be proportional to the average mass of encapsulated oligomers. Knowing the actual mass of TRiC (∼950 kDa) allowed for the scaling of masses in arbitrary units, yielding a value of ∼65 kDa for the mass within the cavity. Taken together, our two estimates indicate an average size of ∼60 kDa for mhttQ51 oligomers encapsulated by TRiC."

      "content": "Finally, in the rotational correlation plots for the cavity-empty average (Figure 5A) and the cavity-occupied average before the substrate was localized (Figure 5B), the seven peaks in correlation (excluding the first peak) have a somewhat uniform height. On the other hand, the plot dips at azimuth equal to 180° for the cavity-occupied average (Figure 8A). The first peak is bound to be higher in any rotational correlation plot because self-correlation will always be at its maximum when no rotations have occurred (all voxels in the volume correlate well; even those beyond the molecule but within the box). The difference in height (or correlation) between the next two highest peaks (two and eight) with the middle peak (five) in the rotational correlation plot of the cavity-occupied average arises from the mass of the encapsulated density: when the mass coincides perfectly with its copy, there is high correlation; when it is in opposite alignment to itself, the correlation dips. Therefore, using the mass of TRiC (∼950 kDa) to scale this difference indicates a substrate size of ∼50 kDA. This is slightly underestimated, since the difference would ideally be calculated between the first and the middle peaks, but the first peak is unusable due to the perfect correlation of all voxels at the default position before any rotations occur."
