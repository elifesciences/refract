      "content": "A substantial fraction of the metazoan transcriptome undergoes circadian oscillations in many cells and tissues. Based on the transcription feedback loops important for circadian timekeeping, it is commonly assumed that this mRNA cycling reflects widespread transcriptional regulation. To address this issue, we directly measured the circadian dynamics of mouse liver transcription using Nascent-Seq (genome-wide sequencing of nascent RNA). Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed, many rhythmic mRNAs manifest poor transcriptional rhythms, indicating a prominent contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA expression. This analysis of rhythmic transcription also showed that the rhythmic DNA binding profile of the transcription factors CLOCK and BMAL1 does not determine the transcriptional phase of most target genes. This likely reflects gene-specific collaborations of CLK:BMAL1 with other transcription factors. These insights from Nascent-Seq indicate that it should have broad applicability to many other gene expression regulatory issues."

      "content": "Experiments have shown that the circadian system in mammals relies on feedback loops that operate at the level of individual cells. These loops are controlled by two particular proteins, which comprise the transcription factor complex called BMAL1:CLK. Transcription factors cause particular sequences of bases in the DNA of cells to be transcribed into messenger RNA, thus starting the process by which target genes are expressed as proteins. In the case of BMAL1:CLK, these proteins are then modified, which inhibits any further transcription of the target genes. A reversal of these modifications is then followed by the synthesis of new proteins, which allows a new cycle of the transcription process to begin."

More recently, however, it was suggested that other processes, such as splicing and translation, might also contribute to rhythmic changes in the amount of mRNA associated with particular genes. Such post-transcriptional processes are known to have a role in other areas of cell biology, including aspects of the circadian system, but until very recently this had not been studied in detail for all genes."

They compared this with the amount of liver mRNA expressed at six time points of the day. Although the authors found that many genes exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression in the mouse liver, about 70% of them did not show comparable transcriptional rhythms. Post-transcriptional regulation must, therefore, have a major role in the circadian system of mice and, presumably, other mammals."

The circadian system in eukaryotes is based on cell-autonomous molecular oscillators, which rely on transcriptional feedback loops. In mammals, the transcription factor BMAL1 acts as a dimer with either CLOCK (CLK) or Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) to activate the transcription of many genes, including the transcriptional repressors Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2). The PERs and CRYs are expressed, post-translationally modified, feedback to inhibit their own transcription and are then rhythmically degraded to lead to a new round of BMAL1:CLK or BMAL1:NPAS2 -mediated transcription (reviewed in Ko and Takahashi, 2006; Dardente and Cermakian, 2007). This temporal regulation of clock gene transcription cycles with a period of about 24 hr and probably underlies much of circadian biology."

      "content": "Over the past decade, clock gene transcriptional regulation has been described in many species and tissues, where it drives the rhythmic expression of a large fraction of the mRNA population (up to 10–15% of all mRNAs in a single mammalian tissue; Lowrey and Takahashi, 2004; Vollmers et al., 2009). Rhythmic mRNA expression has mostly been characterized by analyzing temporal changes of steady-state mRNA levels, using techniques such as microarrays (e.g., McDonald and Rosbash, 2001; Panda et al., 2002; Storch et al., 2002) and more recently high-throughput sequencing (Hughes et al., 2012). It is generally assumed that these rhythms in mRNA expression directly result from temporal changes in transcription. There are, however, a few reports indicating that post-transcriptional regulation contributes to rhythmic mRNA expression of several genes, including core clock genes (reviewed in Kojima et al., 2011; Staiger and Green, 2011; Staiger and Koster, 2011; Zhang et al., 2011), but this has never been studied in detail at the genome-wide level. Circadian post-transcriptional regulation may impact rhythmic mRNA expression at many different levels, such as mRNA splicing, stability and translation. For example, post-transcriptional events rhythmically regulate the mRNA half-life of the mammalian clock genes Per2 and Cry1 and the Drosophila clock gene per (So and Rosbash, 1997; Woo et al., 2009; Woo et al., 2010). Moreover, several RNA-binding proteins such as LARK, hnRNP I, hnRNP P, hnRNP Q or the circadian deadenylase NOCTURNIN have been shown to regulate circadian gene expression and/or circadian behavior (reviewed in Kojima et al., 2011). These different modes of post-transcriptional regulation are not restricted to circadian biology (Keene, 2007) and have been shown in other systems to regulate cellular mRNA levels independent of transcriptional regulation (Giege et al., 2000; Cheadle et al., 2005)."

We performed a parallel analysis of rhythmic mRNA expression with RNA-Seq and compared the two sequencing datasets. Although many genes are rhythmically transcribed in the mouse liver (∼15% of all detected genes), only 42% of these rhythmically transcribed genes show mRNA oscillations. More importantly, about 70% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression do not show transcriptional rhythms, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in defining the rhythmic mRNA landscape. To assess the contribution of the core molecular clock to genome-wide transcriptional rhythms, we also examined how rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding directly affects the transcription of its target genes. Although maximal binding occurs at an apparently uniform phase, the peak transcriptional phases of CLK:BMAL1 target genes are heterogeneous, which indicates a disconnect between CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and its transcriptional output. The data taken together reveal novel regulatory features of rhythmic gene expression and highlight Nascent-Seq as an important genome-wide assay for the study of gene expression."

To this end, nascent RNA was extracted from purified nuclei using the high salt/urea/detergent buffer originally described by Wuarin and Schibler (1994). A very similar sequencing strategy was recently applied by Smale, Black and colleagues to macrophage nascent RNA (Bhatt et al., 2012). We then prepared illumina libraries with standard protocols for high-throughput sequencing (Nascent-Seq; Carrillo Oesterreich et al., 2010; Khodor et al., 2011). Removal of rRNA was unnecessary as approximately 65–70% of the sequences uniquely mapped to the genome (Table 1)."

This contrasts dramatically with more conventional RNA-Seq; it has minimal intron reads as it assays polyadenylated (pA) RNA and therefore predominantly mature (spliced) mRNA (Figure 1A). Intronic Nascent-Seq reads are also more abundant in mouse compared to Drosophila (76% vs 45%), reflecting longer intron size and less efficient mouse co-transcriptional splicing (Khodor et al., 2012; Khodor et al., 2011). Many genes exhibit a 5′ to 3′ gradient in the Nascent-Seq dataset, presumably reflecting nascent RNAs of different lengths attached to elongating Pol II (Figure 1B). In addition, Nascent-Seq signals frequently extend past the polyadenylation site, reflecting RNA not yet cleaved by the cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and/or RNA molecules still associated with Pol II after cleavage but prior to degradation by the 5′ to 3′ exoribonuclease Xrn2 (Figure 1C). These features are absent from standard RNA-Seq data, and indicate that Nascent-Seq predominantly detects nascent RNA molecules attached to elongating Pol II (Figure 1B,C)."

(B): Visualization of Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq signal at chr4: 40,730,000–41,002,500. Genes above the scale bar are transcribed from left to right and those below the scale bar are transcribed from right to left. Nascent-Seq signal exhibits increased intron signal and a 5ʹ to 3ʹ gradient signal (arrow). Moreover, differences between Nascent-Seq signal and RNA-Seq signal are observed for many genes (e.g., Bag1 and B4galt1). (C): Nascent-Seq signal (brown), but not RNA-Seq signal (red), extends past the annotated 3ʹend of the genes B4galt1 and Nfx1. (D): Gene ontology of genes with high Nascent-Seq and low RNA-Seq signals (and inversely) is indicative of RNA with short or long half-lives, respectively (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). (E): Distribution of the Nascent-Seq/RNA-Seq signal ratio for the classes of genes enriched in (D). (F): Nascent-Seq/RNA-Seq signal ratio significantly correlates with mRNA half-lives (values from Sharova et al., 2009), and genes with high ratio display shorter half-lives and inversely. (G) and (H): Strategy used to determine the gene signal cut-off threshold used in our analysis. Variation of gene signal coming from the sequencing of a Nascent-Seq library (G; ZT8, replicate 1) sequenced in two Illumina flow-cell lanes was assessed by calculating the z-score (H). Less than 5% of the genes with a read per base pair superior to three exhibit a 1.3-fold gene signal variation. See ‘Materials and methods’ for more details."

Some genes have a high ratio of Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq signal (e.g., B4galt1, Figure 1B), whereas others have a low ratio (e.g., Bag1, Figure 1B). Genes with a high ratio (top 10% of all genes) are dramatically enriched for specific functions, namely, non-coding RNA (ncRNA), G-coupled protein receptors, regulation of transcription and chromatin organization (Figure 1D,E). Genes with a low ratio are enriched for genes involved in ribosome function and mitochondrial respiration (Figure 1D,E). Because these genes are associated with short or long mRNA half-lives, respectively, we compared the Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq ratios of genes with their published mRNA half-lives (Sharova et al., 2009). Not surprisingly, genes with a high ratio have relatively short half-lives, and genes with low ratios have longer mRNA half-lives (Figure 1F). These data indicates that mRNA stability contributes to the wide range of Nascent-Seq to RNA-Seq ratios."

Four categories of rhythmically expressed genes were determined by comparing the Nascent-Seq and RNA-Seq datasets: rhythmic nascent RNA and mRNA (R-R), rhythmic nascent RNA only (R-AR), rhythmic mRNA only (AR-R) and arrhythmic nascent RNA and mRNA (AR-AR). (B): Heatmap representation of genes with rhythmic nascent RNA and mRNA expression (n = 342). Classification is based on the phase of nascent RNA oscillations, and each lane corresponds to one gene. (C): Double-plotted phase distribution of rhythmic nascent RNA expression (brown) and rhythmic mRNA expression (red) for genes of the R-R gene set. Both phases are highly correlated (r = 0.92). (D): Distribution of the difference between the phase of mRNA expression rhythm and the phase of nascent RNA expression rhythm for the 342 R-R genes. (E): Amplitude of mRNA expression rhythms are correlated with nascent RNA expression rhythms (r = 0.76). (F) and (G): Similar representation to (B) for rhythmically transcribed genes with no mRNA expression rhythms (C, n = 480), and genes that exhibit mRNA oscillations but no rhythms of transcription (D, n = 862). For all three heatmaps, high expression is displayed in yellow (z-score > 1), low expression in blue (z-score < 1)."

However, the mRNA phase of these R-R genes was highly correlated to the nascent RNA phase (r = 0.92; Figure 3C), and more than half (57%) of these genes exhibit a phase difference of less than 2 hr (195/342; Figure 3D). The amplitudes of the nascent RNA rhythms were also correlated with those of mRNA (r = 0.76; Figure 3E), indicating that transcriptional regulation dominates these R-R rhythms. Not surprisingly, almost all clock genes (Figure 4) and well-characterized clock-controlled genes (e.g., Nocturnin, Por, Alas1, Upp2, Usp2, Inmt, Nfil3, etc; Figure 3—source data 1) are in this R-R gene set."

A simple explanation is that the mRNA half-lives of these R-AR genes are relatively long and therefore mask the transcriptional oscillations. However, these genes do not have altered nascent RNA to mRNA ratios compared to the whole genome (Figure 5A) or reported longer mRNA half-lives (assessed using the dataset from Sharova et al., 2009; Figure 5B). These considerations suggest that other mechanisms account for the poor mRNA oscillations of this gene set (e.g., the rhythmic Nascent-Seq signal of 25 R-AR genes results from rhythmic transcription of an adjacent gene that reads into the R-AR gene; Figure 5C)."

This might include the circadian regulation of nuclear RNA processing, export, translational regulation and/or mRNA turnover, as described for the few circadian genes shown to be regulated post-transcriptionally (Kojima et al., 2011; Staiger and Koster, 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Gene ontology analysis of this arrhythmic transcription-rhythmic mRNA (AR-R) gene set did not reveal any striking enrichment of particular gene functions (Figure 5D)."

While the majority of the AR-R genes exhibit variable nascent RNA expression (A), some of them exhibit a relatively constant transcription when compared to mRNA expression (B). (C): Standard deviation (SD; calculated using the 12 time points and normalized to the mean) of nascent RNA expression is higher than the SD normalized to the mean of mRNA levels for most AR-R genes. (D) and (E): Higher transcriptional variability (SD) of arrhythmically transcribed genes is associated with higher occurrence of rhythmic mRNA expression (D), but not to nascent RNA expression levels (E). (F): Higher variability of transcription for the genes of the AR-R group is associated with increase amplitude of rhythms at both Nascent RNA (brown) and mRNA (red) level. Genes of the AR-R group (n = 862) were binned into five quintiles of equal size (q1–q5). (G): Heatmap representation of 86 AR-R genes that exhibit high level of transcription at only one time point, and with rhythmic mRNA expression. High expression is displayed in yellow (z-score > 1), low expression in blue (z-score < 1).

(J): Gene ontology of AR-R genes with high transcriptional variability (top 25%) when compared to all AR-R genes. Significant enrichment (top) and depletion (bottom) of biological functions for these genes are displayed.

The reasoning was that low variability expression between time points should result in a low SD. The SD was noticeably higher in the Nascent-Seq dataset than in the RNA-Seq dataset, indicating that the transcription of most AR-R genes is indeed variable compared to the mRNA-Seq dataset (Figure 6C; note that most points are to the right of the diagonal line). Higher variability of nascent RNA expression is also observed for other categories, including the AR-AR set (data not shown), suggesting that it is a common feature of transcription vs mRNA comparisons independent of circadian considerations."

More variable transcription is also associated with higher amplitudes of rhythmic mRNA expression (Figure 6F). This correlation is valid for most AR-R genes (∼80%, Figure 6F), suggesting that this transcriptional variability or noise has a significant role in the emergence of rhythmic mRNA expression from arrhythmic transcription."

This ability of post-transcriptional regulation to generate rhythmic mRNA oscillations is selective, as not all arrhythmically transcribed genes with variable transcription exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression (Figure 6H). Moreover, not all genes exhibit variable transcriptional profiles (Figure 6B, see below)."

Because a large fraction of them are directly targeted by the core clock, we asked how CLK:BMAL1 regulates the transcription of its target genes at the genome-wide level. We also took advantage of our Nascent-Seq dataset to establish whether the phase differences between rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and rhythmic target gene mRNA expression (Rey et al., 2011) reflect transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation."

As expected, CLK and BMAL1 target many DNA binding sites in mouse liver (759 and 1579, respectively) and significantly overlap on 211 of these peaks (Figure 7A). Although highly significant (chi-square test, p<0.0001), the rather low fraction may indicate competition between CLK:BMAL1 and NPAS2:BMAL1 for binding sites. Importantly, about 90% of these 211 peaks have been previously characterized as rhythmic BMAL1 DNA binding sites in mouse liver (Rey et al., 2011)."

Normalization was performed on the entire datasets by calculating the z-score ((x − mean)/SD). Heatmap displays high expression in red and low expression in blue. Quantification (B) was performed by averaging the z-score by bins of 25 bp for all CLK:BMAL1 peaks (n = 211), BMAL1 only peaks (n = 1368) and CLK only peaks (n = 548). (C): Enrichment of e-boxes (perfect CACGTG in red, degenerated e-boxes [one nucleotide mismatch, in orange]) within ±500 bp of CLK:BMAL1, BMAL1 only and CLK only peak centers.

They include the expected core clock genes (Figure 7E–G) as well as other interesting targets.

This is because BMAL1 binding is essentially uniform at ZT3-5, whereas the transcription peaks are much more broadly distributed (Figure 8A,B). Remarkably, this is also true for the core clock genes. Whereas a small number have the expected phase similar to that of CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding (Rev-Erbα, Dbp; Figure 7E), the transcription of most target genes is significantly delayed. They include Per1 (Figure 7F), Cry1 (Figure 7G) and Per2 (8E). As recently proposed for Cry1 (Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011), this general delay in the peak of rhythmic transcription may be due to a collaboration of CLK:BMAL1 with other transcription factors (Rev-erbα and Dbp in the case of Cry 1)."

The levels of Per1, Per2 and Cry1 pre-mRNAs in Bmal1−/− mice are higher than the trough of expression in wild-type mice, indicating that other transcriptional regulators are indeed important for the transcription of these three clock genes (Figure 8D). This notion is also supported by the enrichment of other transcription factor motifs such as HNF3/FOXA1, SP1 and E4BP4 adjacent to CLK:BMAL1 binding sites (Figure 7D)."

However, the application here of Nascent-Seq to genome-wide mouse liver transcriptional rhythms indicates that about 70% of the genes that exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression do not have robust transcriptional rhythms (AR-R category), suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms are important for the generation of robust mRNA rhythms. Yet the transcription of most AR-R genes is variable, with elevated levels coinciding with the peak of the rhythmic mRNA profile. This suggests that post-transcriptional events buffer variable transcriptional output to generate robust and reproducible rhythms of mRNA expression (Figure 9). A similar Nascent-Seq vs RNA-Seq strategy for Drosophila head RNA (Joe Rodriguez and Michael Rosbash, personal communication) and a very recently published paper based on a different strategy for assessing liver transcriptional rhythms (Koike et al., 2012) come to a generally similar conclusion, namely, a widespread contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to circadian mRNA cycling."

Many post-transcriptional cyclers exhibit highly variable transcription that is buffered to generate robust rhythmic mRNA expression. Few genes exhibit a relatively constant transcription when compared to mRNA expression. These post-transcriptional events may include roles for RNA binding proteins and miRNAs to regulate RNA stability, 3′ end formation and nuclei export."

Because the half-lives of nascent transcripts are generally much shorter than those of mRNA (Griffiths-Jones, 2007; Mattick, 2009; Mercer et al., 2009; Wang and Chang, 2011), a short burst of transcription can result in elevated mRNA expression that lasts several hours, as has been shown in systems involving an acute inflammatory response (Cheadle et al., 2005; Hao and Baltimore, 2009). However, generic mRNA stability cannot account for this buffering, as many genes with arrhythmic but variable transcription do not exhibit rhythmic mRNA expression (Figure 6H). This suggests that the post-transcriptional buffering is clock-controlled and selective for specific genes."

      "content": "Because our experiments were done under LD conditions, it is possible that some cycling RNAs and mechanisms are not circadian but driven by the LD cycle. Nonetheless, it is likely that many of them also occur under DD conditions and that specific and perhaps multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to rhythmic mRNA expression. They may include 3′ end formation and coupled polyadenylation, splicing, mRNA export as well as cytoplasmic events involving translation, RNA binding proteins (RBP) and miRNAs (Joshi et al., 2012). Interestingly, a few recent reports highlight the tight coupling between transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional events that govern mRNA stability (Bregman et al., 2011; Trcek et al., 2011). In these examples, RBPs are recruited by specific transcription factors, which then help load the RBPs onto nascent RNA; they then control cytoplasmic mRNA stability (Bregman et al., 2011; Trcek et al., 2011). A mechanism of this nature could account for the post-transcriptional generation of rhythmic mRNA expression."

The transcription of many metabolic genes is regulated by metabolites and/or hormones (e.g., transcription of Sds is induced by glucagon and CREB, Haas and Pitot, 1999). A large fraction of rhythmic mRNAs may therefore result from a transcriptional response, dependent on the cellular environment, as well as post-transcriptional events that stabilize mRNA at an appropriate time of the day. This scenario could also explain the R-AR gene set: despite rhythmic transcription, the lack of rhythmic post-transcriptional regulation would negate the transcriptional oscillations."

The transcriptional phase of these target genes is heterogeneous and distributed throughout the day, despite a more discrete phase of BMAL1 DNA binding at the beginning of the light phase. This indicates that transcriptional output is not identical for all target genes and suggests that CLK:BMAL1 cooperates with other transcription factors to establish the phase of transcription, as previously shown only for the Cry1 gene (Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2011). In addition, transcription of most of these target genes is arrhythmic but not absent without BMAL1. This feature of target gene expression as well as the heterogeneity of phase is unlike what is observed in flies: core CLK:CYC target genes exhibit a discrete phase of expression that matches the phase of DNA binding (Abruzzi et al., 2011)."

The first is that rhythmic transcriptional regulation is sufficient to describe the cycling gene expression landscape. The second is that CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding alone sets the phase of, and is essential for, core clock gene transcription. The dramatic, genome-wide disconnect between the phases of rhythmic CLK:BMAL1 DNA binding and rhythmic target gene transcription suggests that other transcription factors and/or mechanisms collaborate with CLK:BMAL1 binding and are critical to determine the phase of clock gene transcription. We anticipate that Nascent-Seq will impact gene expression regulation far beyond the circadian applications shown here."

Moreover, because ‘only’ approximately 13% of the Nascent-Seq signal is mapped to exons (most of the signal is intronic), we reached a higher sequencing depth for the Nascent-Seq samples (>15,000,000 uniquely mapped sequences for all samples, representing a minimum of 160,000,000 nucleotides mapping to the transcriptome)."

Indeed, among genes with a rpbp superior to 2, less than 6.7% display a variation of more than 1.3-fold between the two duplicates (432/6486) and only 88 genes (1.36%) display a variation of more than 1.5-fold (88/6486; see Table 2). Moreover, the majority of these genes are relatively short (<1 kb), hence contributing for some of the variability. This analysis therefore indicates that a rpbp of 2–3 (for datasets with ∼20,000,000 uniquely mapped sequences of 80 nt) can be used as a threshold to detect biological variation of nascent RNA expression."

Significant peaks were computationally assigned to a gene. Briefly, a peak located between the transcription start site and the transcription start end of a gene was assigned to that gene, regardless of the ChIP-Seq peak position. The other peaks, referred as intergenic, were assigned to the gene with the closest transcription start site. Confirmation of this computational gene assignment was then confirmed by manual inspection for the 211 CLK:BMAL1 peaks. Visualization of the ChIP-seq signal was performed using the wig output file (from the MACS analysis) and the IGB browser."
