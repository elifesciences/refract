Apical localization and activity of Dia are at the core of restricting F-actin formation to the correct membrane domain. Here we identify the mechanisms that target Dia to the apical surface. PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane regulate Dia localization in both the MDCK cyst model and in Drosophila tubular epithelia. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is crucial for apical localization, implying direct binding to PI(4,5)P2. Dia apical targeting also depends on binding to Rho1, which is critical for activation-induced conformational change, as well as physically anchoring Dia to the apical membrane. We demonstrate that binding to Rho1 facilitates interaction with PI(4,5)P2 at the plane of the membrane. Together these cues ensure efficient and distinct restriction of Dia to the apical membrane."

In most tissues, this sense of direction relies on certain proteins and infrastructure components of the cell being located in specific subcellular regions, rather than being distributed in a more symmetrical fashion throughout the cell: the latter phenomenon is known as cell polarity."

      "content": "Exocrine tissues (that is, glands) are composed of tubular epithelial cells organized around a central lumen: the cells in the gland secrete various products (such as enzymes) into the lumen, so that they can be carried to the target organ elsewhere in the body. Epithelial cells in these tissues are therefore polarized to enable directional transport to the lumen. An example of cell polarity is a network of actin filaments that lines the apical surface of these cells (the surface nearest the common lumen). This actin network helps to shuttle cargo to the lumen by assisting with directional, coordinated secretion, among other processes."

      "content": "In fruitflies, the construction of the apical actin network depends on the presence of a protein called Diaphanous. However, the signals that lead to the localization of this protein near the apical membrane of the cells are not well understood. Now Rousso et al. report that a modified lipid, called PI(4,5)P2, is involved in this localization. However, they also show that this lipid does not govern the apical localization of Diaphanous on its own: rather, an enzyme called Rho1 must also be present to assist with the localization of Diaphanous and to ensure that actin is deposited in the correct place. Rousso et al. also demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2-mediated localization of Drosophila Diaphanous occurs in mammalian cells. Lipid-protein collaboration also targets other proteins to the apical membrane. A common mechanism may therefore underlie cell polarity in tubular organ tissues in flies and mammals."

Polarization is apparent in the distinct composition of membrane domains: the apical membrane—the surface facing the lumen, the basal membrane, which contacts the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM), and the lateral surfaces, which contain specialized cellular junctions that adhere adjacent cells (Bryant and Mostov, 2008). The generation and maintenance of cell polarity is achieved by domain-specific proteins and lipids, which support the unique organization and function of each region. Among these, asymmetric distribution of phosphoinositides has been shown to be crucial for membrane identity and lumen formation in tubular systems. PI(4,5)P2 in the apical surface and PI(3,4,5)P3 in the basal membrane have been shown to tether specific polarity and cytoskeleton related proteins, which define their respective domains (Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2007)."

One such structure, which is a common feature of tubular tissues, is a network of actin microfilaments lining the apical surface of the tube cells. In a previous study we found that in Drosophila tubular organs, this network mediates myosinV based transport of vesicles, promoting their secretion from the apical surface into the tube lumen. The actin-nucleator responsible for generating these structures was shown to be the formin-family protein Diaphanous (Dia) (Massarwa et al., 2009)."

      "content": "Dia belongs to the formin family of actin nucleators, which regulate the formation of linear actin cables. The Dia-related formins (DRFs) can be functionally divided into two major domains, each encompassing roughly one half of the protein sequence (Goode and Eck, 2007). The C-terminal portion of DRFs regulates actin polymer assembly by mediating microfilament nucleation, elongation and processive capping. Key functional sub-domains include the FH2 domain, which acts as a dimer, and moves processively with the growing barbed end, and the FH1 domain, which together with profilin acts to accelerate filament elongation by recruiting monomeric actin. The N-terminal portion of DRF nucleators is regulatory, governing the activation state of the molecule through interactions with various effectors. Importantly, this region has been shown to play significant roles in directing DRF localization in vivo (reviewed in Higgs, 2005; Chesarone et al., 2010). DRFs are autoinhibited due to an intra-molecular interaction between the C-terminal DAD domain and the N-terminal DID domain, which maintains the molecule in a closed conformation. Upon binding of GTP-bound Rho1 to the N-terminal GTPase-binding domain, autoinhibition is relieved, allowing Dia to assume an open, active conformation and promote actin polymerization (Lammers et al., 2005; Otomo et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005)."

Accordingly, Dia-like proteins assume distinct subcellular localizations in a cell type specific manner. To prevent spatially unrestricted actin assembly in cells, localization of DRFs is highly regulated, and involves different factors and mechanisms. For example, the yeast formin Bni1p localizes during budding to the mother cell bud neck, by binding to the polarity factor Spa2, via a mechanism that involves four different localizing domains (Liu et al., 2012). Targeting of mDia2, a mammalian homologue of Dia, to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis, is achieved by binding to the scaffold protein anillin (Watanabe et al., 2010). In Drosophila, Dia is recruited to lamellipodia by the actin regulator Ena/Vasp in a small subset of epidermal cells, during the process of embryonic dorsal closure (Homem and Peifer, 2009). In Drosophila tubular structures, dia mRNA is tightly concentrated at the apical side of the cells, by a mechanism that was shown to be distinct from the Dia protein apical targeting mechanism (Massarwa et al., 2009). Thus, targeting of Dia-like proteins is regulated at multiple levels, to assure restriction of activity to the correct cellular domain."

We find that efficient apical targeting of Dia requires the detection of both PI(4,5)P2 and Rho1 on the apical surface. We show, both in a mammalian cell culture model and by genetic manipulations in Drosophila tubular organs, that PI(4,5)P2 levels regulate Dia localization. An N-terminal basic domain of Dia is critical for this regulation, indicative of an electrostatic-based direct interaction between Dia and PI(4,5)P2. We demonstrate that apical enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 is a common feature of tubular organs in the fly, which can be attributed in part to the apical restriction of the PIP5 kinase (PIP5K) Skittles. We further show that Rho1 facilitates Dia apical targeting, both by inducing the Dia open conformation, thereby exposing N-terminal domains that are critical for localization, as well as by physically anchoring Dia to the apical surface. This anchoring appears to promote the Dia–PI(4,5)P2 interaction, leading to synergistic effects of these two apical cues. We therefore propose that a multi-tiered targeting mechanism, utilizing both global and specific features of tubular organs, achieves a distinct localization pattern of Dia, thereby enabling execution of the cardinal process of apical secretion in these organs."

To dissect and quantitatively assess the structural basis for this polarized distribution, we monitored the localization patterns of different GFP-tagged Dia constructs (Figure 2A), following tissue-specific expression in several tubular organs. These constructs do not contain the 3′UTR sequences mediating RNA localization, and thus reflect targeting at the protein level. Upon expression at similar levels to endogenous Dia (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), a full-length Dia construct (GFP-Dia-FL) displayed an apically polarized distribution, albeit less dramatic than the endogenous protein (Figure 1D–F). Measurements of GFP intensity in embryonic salivary gland cells further substantiated the enrichment of GFP-Dia-FL at the apical surface, relative to both the cell cytoplasm and to the septate junction (SJ) domain, representing the lateral membrane (Figure 1J–L and Figure 1—figure supplement 1)."

      "content": "(A–C′) Endogenous Dia staining (red, shown separately [grey] in single-primed panels) shows apical localization in the trachea (A), hindgut (HG, B) and salivary gland (SG, C) of stage 15 embryos. Trh (blue, A) marks nuclei of tracheal cells. Crumbs (blue, B and C) marks the apical surface. Apical surfaces face the lumen (L). (D–I′) The localization of GFP-tagged Dia constructs (Figure 2A, green and shown separately [grey] in single-primed panels) was monitored following expression in stage 14–15 embryonic trachea, hindgut and salivary gland under btl-Gal4 (D and G), drm-Gal4 (E and H) and fkh-Gal4 (F and I), respectively. Trh (blue, D and G) marks nuclei of tracheal cells. Dlg and FasIII (blue, E,F,H,I) mark septate junctions. GFP-Dia-ΔDAD (G–I′) is more apically localized than GFP-Dia-FL (D–F′). Scale bars, 10 μm. (J–L) Quantification of GFP fluorescence-intensity ratios. All measurements were carried out on confocal images of the different constructs expressed in the salivary gland. (J and K) Illustration of the different cellular domains measured in GFP-Dia-FL (J) and GFP-Dia-ΔDAD (K) expressing salivary gland cells. A–apical domain (outlined in yellow), SJ–septate junctions (outlined in blue), C–cytoplasm (outlined in white), N–nucleus. (L) Apical enrichment quantification represented by the mean pixel intensity ratio between the apical domain and the cytoplasm (A/C) or the septate junctions region (A/SJ). Error bars represent standard error. n = 20. See also Figure 1—figure supplement 1."

Trh (blue) marks nuclei of tracheal cells. Scale bar, 10 µm. (B) Expression levels of GFP-Dia-FL and GFP-DiaΔDAD are similar. (a and b) Live imaging of whole embryos expressing the indicated constructs under drm-Gal4 showing the hindgut and Malpighian tubules. Scale bar, 20 μm. (c) Lysates of embryos expressing the indicated constructs were probed with an anti-GFP antibody and anti-Actin as a loading control. GFP-Dia-FL and GFP-DiaΔDAD are apparent at ≈150 kDa and ≈145 kDa, respectively (arrowhead), but are absent from lysates of yw embryos. (C) Quantification of GFP intensity in salivary gland cells expressing GFP-Dia-FL (blue bars) and GFP-Dia-ΔDAD (red bars) (Figure 1F,I and J,K). Left chart: percentage of intensity that is concentrated in the apical membrane and cytoplasmic domains from the total intensity in the cell. Right chart: percentage of intensity that is concentrated in the lateral membrane domain (represented by the septate junctions [SJ]), from the total intensity in the cell. While a significant shift in GFP fluorescence levels from the cytoplasm to the apical domain is observed between GFP-Dia-FL and GFP-Dia-ΔDAD expressing cells, GFP fluorescence levels in the lateral membrane domain remain the same. Error bars represent standard error, n = 19–20."

      "content": "Removal of the extreme C-terminus of Dia, which includes the DAD domain (GFP-Dia-ΔDAD), generates an open form of Dia, which is relieved from auto-inhibition (Li and Higgs, 2003). While expression of this construct in tubular epithelia results in protein levels similar to the full-length form (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), GFP-Dia-ΔDAD displays a much tighter apical localization pattern (Figure 1G–I), suggesting that the molecule is now more accessible to apical-targeting signals. Quantification demonstrates that apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-ΔDAD is enhanced up to fourfold relative to GFP-Dia-FL (Figure 1J–L). Further measurements in GFP-Dia-ΔDAD expressing cells reveal that ∼45% of the total GFP intensity in the cell is concentrated at the apical surface, which encompasses only ∼5% of the total cell area. When compared with the GFP-Dia-FL expressing cells, a clear shift in the GFP distribution is observed from the cytoplasm to the apical domain. In contrast, a similar degree of localization to the lateral membrane SJ domain is exhibited by both constructs (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Thus, enhanced apical localization of GFP-Dia-ΔDAD appears to result primarily from efficient apical recruitment of its cytoplasmic pool. The intensity differences between the apical and cytoplasmic domains were therefore used in this study as the primary measure for apical enrichment of Dia constructs."

While these assays focused on the embryonic salivary gland, qualitatively similar observations were made in other tubular organs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We initially examined separately the localizing activity of the two halves of the Dia-ΔDAD protein, each of which harbors distinct functional domains. A construct containing only the C-terminal half (GFP-Dia-C′) was distributed within the cytoplasm upon expression in tubular epithelia (Figure 2B and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In contrast, the reciprocal N-terminal construct (GFP-Dia-N′) displayed striking apical enrichment, reminiscent of the localization pattern of the intact GFP-Dia-ΔDAD open molecule (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Indeed, quantification of relative fluorescence levels demonstrated strong apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-N′, while no apical bias whatsoever was observed for GFP-Dia-C′ (Figure 2E). These observations suggest that the N-terminal half of Dia is both necessary and sufficient for apical targeting."

Phosphoinositides are general regulators of membrane identity in tubular tissues. In 3D cysts of cultured Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a well-established system for recapitulation of epithelial tube morphogenesis, PI(4,5)P2 is a key determinant of the apical membrane, where it is highly enriched (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007). We therefore utilized the MDCK cyst system, in which phosphoinositide levels can be readily manipulated, to examine a possible role for PI(4,5)P2 in the regulation of Dia localization."

(C–F′) GFP-Dia-ΔDAD expressing MDCK cysts were incubated with histone (no lipid, C–D′) or PI(4,5)P2-histone complexes (+PI(4,5)P2, E–F′) for up to 10 min. Exogenous PI(4,5)P2 re-localized GFP-Dia-ΔDAD to the basal membrane (E and magnified in F) in comparison to control cysts (C and magnified in D). Apical enrichment is slightly reduced in the control cysts (compare C with B), probably due to pre-incubation with Trypsin and low-calcium levels. Nuclei are stained with Hoechst. Apical surfaces face the lumen (L). Scale bars, 10 μm."

To directly test the involvement of PI(4,5)P2 in Dia localization, we delivered exogenous PI(4,5)P2 to the basal surface of cysts expressing GFP-Dia-ΔDAD (Gassama-Diagne et al., 2006), and monitored the effects on its localization pattern. GFP-Dia-ΔDAD localization was dramatically altered, even after very short treatments of 10 min, displaying redistribution from the apical to the basal surface, while remaining apical in mock treated cysts (Figure 3C–F). The rapid shift in GFP-Dia-ΔDAD localization preceded the general shift in polarity induced by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment in this system (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007). This can be readily appreciated by the partial basolateral localization of the apical membrane marker gp-135, which no longer co-localized with GFP-Dia-ΔDAD following treatment (Figure 3E,F). The rapid nature of Dia re-localization suggests that recruitment to the baso-lateral membranes is a direct result of exogenous PI(4,5)P2 treatment. These observations imply that PI(4,5)P2 could fulfill a prominent role in the regulation of Dia apical targeting in tubular structures."

To follow the endogenous distribution of PI(4,5)P2, we expressed PH-PLCδ-GFP, a PI(4,5)P2 sensor in which the PH domain of PLCδ is tagged with GFP (Downes et al., 2005), in different tubular organs. Imaging the GFP fluorescence in live tissues showed significant apical enrichment of the sensor in the embryonic hindgut and larval salivary gland cells (Figure 4B,D), which was apparent but less pronounced in the embryonic trachea (Figure 4C). Apical membranes of Drosophila tubular epithelia are therefore enriched in PI(4,5)P2, as in mammalian systems. In general, imaging of these fine subcellular domains in live samples produced clearer and more consistent localization patterns than fixed preparations, leading us to use the live imaging approach whenever applicable, throughout the analysis."

Skittles (Sktl), one of the two Drosophila PIP5-kinases which catalyze PI(4,5)P2 production from PI(4)P (Figure 4A), was shown to be critical for PI(4,5)P2 production in various systems (Gervais et al., 2008; Fabian et al., 2010), and is endogenously expressed in different Drosophila embryonic tubular organs (BDGP-Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project). Indeed, when we expressed an RFP-tagged version of Sktl in Drosophila tubular organs, it was targeted predominantly to the apical surface of cells (Figure 4E–G). Thus, apical targeting of Sktl may account for PI(4,5)P2 accumulation at this membrane."

Supporting this notion is the observation that a mutated form of PIP5-kinase, containing an inactive kinase domain, fails to localize to the same membrane domain as the wild-type protein (Fairn et al., 2009), demonstrating that continuous PI(4,5)P2 generation is required to enhance the localization bias of PIP5-kinases. We find a similar relationship in Drosophila tubular organs between Sktl activity and apical localization: a mutated form of Sktl, where the kinase domain is inactive (Sktl-KID), was no longer enriched apically, and instead assumed a general cortical distribution (Figure 4H–J). We assume that the excess of Sktl-KID molecules may sequester endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 at the apical membrane, compromising localization of Sktl and other PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins, and leading to a disrupted morphology of tubular epithelia (not shown)."

The partial apical localization of GFP-Dia-FL in tracheal cells (Figures 1D and 5A) is barely detectable at late embryonic stages (Figure 5C), but is significantly enhanced upon co-expression with Sktl-RFP (Figure 5A–D). Corresponding measurements of GFP intensities show a clear shift in GFP-Dia-FL distribution from the cytoplasm to the apical domain in Sktl-expressing cells (Figure 5G). Conversely, apical enrichment was not observed following co-expression of Sktl with the GFP-Dia-C′ construct, which does not contain apical targeting activity (Figure 5E). Moreover, GFP-Dia-FL localization was not affected by co-expression with the catalytically inactive form of Sktl (Figure 5F). These results suggest that Sktl-dependent increase in PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane leads to enhanced recruitment of Dia."

Primed panels (grey) show the GFP channel alone. Trh (blue) marks tracheal cell nuclei. (A–D′) The localization of GFP-Dia-FL is shifted from the cytoplasm to the apical surface following co-expression with Sktl-RFP in stage 13 (B and B′) and stage 15 (D and D′) tracheal cells. Compare with the control embryos expressing GFP-Dia-FL alone (A,A′ and C,C′). (E,E′) When co-expressed with Sktl-RFP, the localization of GFP-Dia-C’ remained entirely cytoplasmic. (F and F′) Apical enrichment of GFP-Dia-FL is not enhanced upon co-expression with Sktl-KID-RFP. Scale bars, 10 μm. (G) Quantification of GFP fluorescence intensity in stage 15 tracheal cells. Upper chart: mean pixel intensity ratio between the apical domain and the cytoplasm. Lower chart: percentage of intensity that is concentrated in the apical and cytoplasmic domains from the total intensity in the cell. Error bars represent standard error. n = 11–20. (H–K″) Localization of the indicated constructs was examined by live imaging in third instar larval salivary glands following expression under fkh-Gal4. (H) In WT cells, the PI(4,5)P2 sensor PH-PLCδ-GFP is highly enriched in the apical membrane. (I) Upon co-expression with Pten-RNAi, PH-PLCδ-GFP is re-distributed between the cell membranes, and appears cortical. (J–K″) Co-expression of GFP-Dia-N’ (green) with CD8-RFP (red), which served as a general apical membrane marker. Separate channels (grey) are shown in primed panels. (J–J″) In WT cells, both GFP-Dia-N’ and CD8-RFP are highly restricted apically. (K–K″) In Pten-RNAi expressing cells, GFP-Dia-N’ is re-distributed between the cell membranes and appears cortical, while CD8-RFP remains restricted to the apical membrane. Scale bars, 20 μm."

PTEN has been shown to be associated with the regulation of cell polarity in both Drosophila and mammalian systems (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007; Chartier et al., 2011). PTEN resides at adherens junctions (von Stein et al., 2005), consistent with a role in the maintenance of PI(4,5)P2 levels at the apical membrane. We therefore used RNAi-mediated silencing of Pten to manipulate PI(4,5)P2 levels in vivo, and followed the effect on Dia localization. We chose to perform these studies by imaging of live third instar larval salivary glands. This system offers several favorable features, including large polarized cells with clearly distinguishable domains, avoidance of fixation artifacts, and a relatively long period for depletion of gene products through an RNAi-based approach. Monitoring of the GFP-Dia-N′ construct expressed in this tissue revealed a highly restricted localization to the apical surface of the cells lining the gland lumen (Figure 5J), consistent with our observations in the embryonic salivary gland and other tubular organs."

A pronounced redistribution of the sensor was observed following co-expression of Pten-RNAi, such that the sensor became evenly localized around the cortex of salivary-gland cells (Figure 5I). This redistribution is consistent with studies in MDCK cysts that link the loss of PTEN activity with failure in segregation of PI(4,5)P2 from PI(3,4,5)P3, leading to their homogenous, rather than polarized, membrane distributions (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007)."

To rule out the possibility of secondary effects resulting from a general disruption of cell polarity, we co-expressed an RFP-tagged version of the membrane protein CD8 (CD8-RFP), which resides exclusively in the apical membrane of salivary gland cells (Xu et al., 2002). The localization of the CD8-RFP construct remained apically restricted following Pten knockdown, indicating that the loss of PTEN specifically affected Dia localization (Figure 5J″–K″). Distribution of myristoylated RFP, another apical marker in this tissue, was similarly unaffected (not shown)."

Indeed the Drosophila Dia N-terminal 60 amino acids are also enriched for basic residues (Figure 2A)."

Primed panels (grey) show an enlargement of the marked area. (A and A′) GFP-Rho1 is distributed between the apical domain and the cytoplasm. (B–D′) Apical localization of Dia-N’ is Rho1 dependent. Co-expression with Rho1-RNAi dramatically alters GFP-Dia-N’ localization from apical restriction (B and B′) to a complete cytoplasmic localization (C and C′). Correspondingly, GFP-Dia-N’-mutG, a variant lacking Rho-1 binding capacity, assumes an entirely cytoplasmic distribution (D and D′). Note the expanded lumen of Rho1-RNAi expressing salivary glands (C and C′), previously reported for Rho1 mutant alleles (Xu et al., 2011), indicative of the loss of active Rho1 in this system. (E–F′) Apical localization of Dia-N’ΔBD is Rho1 dependent. Co-expression with Rho1-RNAi dramatically alters GFP-Dia-N’ΔBD localization to a cytoplasmic localization (E and E′, compare with Figure 6B), while GFP-Dia- N’ΔBD -mutG, lacking Rho-1 binding capacity, assumes an entirely cytoplasmic distribution (F and F′). Scale bars, 20 μm. (G) Quantification of GFP intensity in larval (left chart) and embryonic (right chart) salivary gland cells, expressing the indicated constructs under fkh-Gal4 (Figures 6 and 7, Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2). Apical enrichment is represented by the mean pixel intensity ratio between the apical domain and the cytoplasm. For larval salivary gland cells, the values are normalized to measurements of cells expressing cytoplasmic GFP. Due to morphological changes resulting from Rho1–RNAi expression, Dia apical localization is even lower than the baseline. Error bars represent standard error. n = 10–24 glands. (H) A model describing the dynamics of Dia targeting to the apical membrane in Drosophila tubular organs. a) Enrichment of both PI(4,5)P2 and Dia at the apical membrane is an inherent feature of Drosophila tubular epithelial cells. b) In a closed conformation, Dia assumes a cytoplasmic distribution. Dia binding to Rho1-GTP generates an initial apical bias, and promotes PI(4,5)P2 binding via exposure of the N-terminal region and enrichment near the apical membrane. The Dia- PI(4,5)P2 interaction further stabilizes apical membrane association. Dia can shift dynamically between three states, being bound to each of the apical cues alone, or to both simultaneously, increasing the probability for re-binding and therefore the efficiency of apical targeting.

Right chart: percentage of intensity that is concentrated in the apical, cytoplasmic and septate junctions domains from the total intensity in the cell. Error bars represent standard error, n = 10–18. (D–E″) Pten silencing does not effect Rho1 localization in the salivary gland. The localization of the indicated constructs was examined by live imaging (green, shown separately [grey] in single primed panels), following expression in the third instar larval salivary gland under fkh-Gal4. Upon co-expression with a Pten-RNAi construct, GFP-Rho1 remained moderately enriched apically (E and E′), as in control cells (D and D′). CD8-RFP, which served as a general marker for apical membrane morphology, remained restricted to the apical membrane as well (D″–E″). (F) Quantification of GFP intensity ratios in (D, WT) compared with (E, Pten-i), represented by the mean pixel intensity ratio between the apical and basal domains (A/B). Both genotypes exhibit apical enrichment represented by a >1 ratio. Error bars represent standard error, n = 13–17. (G) Rho1 silencing does not effect PI(4,5)P2 localization.

The N-terminus of Dia is composed of several distinct domains that can serve as targets for apical recruitment (Figure 2A). Prominent among these is the GTPase-binding domain, through which Rho1 binds and activates the actin nucleation and elongation capacities of Dia (Otomo et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005). An initial indication that Rho1 can serve as an apical recruitment factor for Dia came from examination of Rho1 protein localization. A GFP-Rho1 construct specifically expressed in third instar larval salivary gland cells showed clear enrichment at the apical surface (Figure 7A), as did a GFP fusion protein expressed from the endogenous Rho1 promoter (not shown). Apical enrichment of GFP-Rho1 was not altered upon co-expression with a dia-RNAi construct, indicating that it is not mediated by Dia protein or by actin structures generated by Dia (Figure 7—figure supplement 1)."

The ability to follow the inherently open Dia-N′ construct, allowed to critically examine the role of Rho1 as a physical anchor for Dia, independent of its role as an activator. GFP-Dia-N′ localization was dramatically altered upon co-expression with a Rho1–RNAi construct, and displayed a uniform distribution in the cytoplasm (Figure 7B–C). Furthermore, a similar outcome was obtained following expression of GFP-Dia-N′-mutG (Figure 2A), a GFP-Dia-N′ variant, which is mutated at residues that confer Rho1 binding (Otomo et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005; Lammers et al., 2008). The distribution of GFP-Dia-N′-mutG was essentially cytoplasmic upon expression in larval salivary glands, as well as in various embryonic tubular tissues (Figure 7D and Figure 7—figure supplement 2), indicating that direct interaction with Rho1 mediates Dia targeting. Thus, apically-localized Rho1 functions to physically anchor Dia to the apical surface, in addition to opening the protein. We assume that Rho1 exerts both activities only in the active, GTP-bound form (Rose et al., 2005)."

Previous studies of the mDia1–Rho1 interaction showed that the BD is dispensable for the formation of an mDia1–Rho1 complex (Otomo et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005). Co-expression of GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD with Rho1-RNAi or expression of a GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD mutG construct resulted in complete loss of apical localization (Figure 7E–G). This indicates that the residual apical localization observed for the GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD construct (Figure 6B) can be attributed to Rho1 binding, consistent with the notion of two distinct functional modules for Dia binding. However, the inability of the BD to direct even a mild bias of apical localization on its own (Figure 6C), suggests that the Dia–PI(4,5)P2 interaction requires simultaneous binding of an apical cue through an additional domain."

While the capacity to bind PI(4,5)P2 does not promote apical localization in the absence of Rho1, it strongly enhances apical targeting of Dia when Rho1 is present (Figure 7G, compare Dia-N′ΔBD with Dia-N′). Similar results were obtained in embryonic salivary glands, where a construct defective in PI(4,5)P2 binding (Dia-N′ΔBD) showed weak apical enrichment (≈2), while a construct defective in Rho1 binding (Dia-N′ΔBD-mutG) showed no apical bias whatsoever (Figure 7G). However, the Dia-N′ construct, in which the binding domains for both cues are intact, displayed apical enrichment values of ≈7, clearly indicative of synergy between Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 in promoting Dia apical localization. Taken together, we show that a partial apical localization bias of Dia by Rho1 binding is significantly enhanced by binding to PI(4,5)P2."

We focused our study of Dia recruitment on tubular epithelial tissues, where Dia was shown to be specifically localized to the apical membrane. This tight apical localization is critical for the formation of polarized actin tracks, guiding apical movement of secretory vesicles that are associated with MyosinV motors (Massarwa et al., 2009). Mechanisms that regulate the apical localization of Dia were examined in distinct tubular organs such as the trachea, salivary glands and hindgut, and at different stages of Drosophila development. This experimental flexibility allowed us to utilize the specific advantages of different tissues, and identify features which are universal to all tubular organs. We found that apical recruitment of Dia is mediated by binding to two distinct elements, PI(4,5)P2 and Rho1. Further analysis suggests that synergism between these two partial signals ensures highly efficient apical localization of active Dia."

Indeed, a reporter for the endogenous levels of PI(4,5)P2 displayed a highly significant apical enrichment in Drosophila tubular organs (Figure 4). The causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in recruiting Dia was demonstrated in several ways. First, Drosophila Dia was apically localized in the heterologous MDCK cell culture system, and its localization was shifted basally within minutes of adding PI(4,5)P2 to the basal membranes (Figure 3). We wish to point out that while in this system Dia localization is regulated by PI(4,5)P2 under both excess and normal conditions, it is currently unknown whether an interaction between Dia and mammalian Rho GTPases also contributes to the apical localization. Second, elevation in Drosophila tubular organs in the levels of Sktl, a PIP5-kinase that generates PI(4,5)P2, gave rise to a corresponding enhancement in the level of apical Dia. Conversely, knockdown of the Pten gene encoding the PI(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase in these tissues resulted in redistribution of PI(4,5)P2, consistent with previous observations (Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007). A corresponding alteration in Dia localization further supports the causal role of PI(4,5)P2 in its localization (Figure 5)."

Over-expression of tagged Sktl resulted in both a massive increase in the levels of apical PI(4,5)P2 (not shown), and accumulation of Sktl at the same domain. In contrast, a Sktl protein that is catalytically inactive was distributed uniformly, when expressed in a similar manner (Figure 4). We assume that the signal targeting Sktl apically may be limited, and capable of providing only an initial bias. The resulting enrichment of PI(4,5)P2 following the activity of Sktl can lead to the recruitment of additional Sktl molecules and amplify this apical bias."

This BD was shown to regulate both activity and recruitment to membranes in cell culture models (Ramalingam et al., 2010; Gorelik et al., 2011). Similar to the mammalian homologues, Drosophila Dia also contains an N-terminal basic domain which is critical for apical localization (Figure 6), and is likely to mediate the association with PI(4,5)P2 through electrostatic interactions with the acidic phospholipid. These interactions are known to be weak, and are usually insufficient to stably associate proteins with the membrane under physiological conditions, requiring coupling to additional membrane-targeting motifs (Mulgrew-Nesbitt et al., 2006). Indeed, the Dia BD proved insufficient to direct apical targeting on its own (Figure 6). In this respect, Dia differs from plant formins, which commonly contain a structured PTEN domain for phospholipid binding. This domain confers strong and more specific association, and is consequently sufficient for cortical localization, without requirement for additional targeting factors (van Gisbergen et al., 2012)."

The constitutively activated, open conformation of Dia was significantly more accessible to apical targeting (Figure 1), probably as a result of exposing the N-terminus more readily to apical-targeting factors. Interestingly, even high levels of the open conformation of Dia were efficiently targeted, indicating that the targeting machinery is in relative excess. Normally, the generation of the open Dia conformation is facilitated by binding to Rho1 (Otomo et al., 2005; Rose et al., 2005). In addition, for some formin-family proteins, phosphorylation of residues adjacent to the DAD domain by a Rho1 effector, ROCK-1, is an essential element in the activation process (Takeya et al., 2008; Staus et al., 2011). It remains to be determined whether ROCK-1 also plays a role in activation of Dia in Drosophila tubular organs."

The distribution of the activated form of Rho1 may be even more apically biased. It appears, however, that Rho1 requires different signals than Dia for its apical localization. Alterations in the PI(4,5)P2 distribution, which resulted in dramatic effects on the localization of Dia, had only a marginal effect on the localization of Rho1 (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). While Dia localization depends on Rho1, the localization of Rho1 is independent of Dia and the apical actin cables it forms (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), suggesting a hierarchy rather than a reinforcing feedback loop between the two proteins. One possibility is that apical Rho1 localization involves anchoring to Rho-GEFs, the specific guanine-exchange factors that activate Rho1, and were also shown to be enriched in apical membranes of Drosophila tubular organs (Massarwa et al., 2009)."

Neither Rho1 nor PI(4,5)P2 is sufficient to efficiently recruit Dia apically on their own. Nevertheless, combining these two relatively weak interactions gives rise to dramatic apical localization of Dia, demonstrating a synergistic contribution (Figure 7). The cooperative contribution of multiple domains within the same protein to drive membrane targeting is termed ‘Coincidence detection’ (Lemmon, 2008). This mechanism for localization of a multidomain protein can be used to generate enhanced targeting specificity. While both Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 may separately reside in other subcellular domains, Dia will bind with high avidity exclusively to the apical membrane that encompasses both cues."

Binding to Rho1 alone was weak but nevertheless detectable. Conversely, binding to PI(4,5)P2 alone was not capable of generating any apical localization bias, despite its marked contribution to apical recruitment in the presence of Rho1 (Figure 7). This asymmetry between the two cues suggests a model for the dynamics of Dia-apical targeting (Figure 7H). Binding to activated Rho1 may represent the more prevalent scenario for the initial interaction of Dia with the apical membrane. This interaction will also give rise to an open conformation of Dia, which is more amenable to targeting, and will provide physical proximity to the membrane. Membrane proximity can now allow the interaction of Dia with PI(4,5)P2, which was not favored when the Dia protein was cytoplasmic, due to low affinity restrictions. The Dia-PI(4,5)P2 interaction stabilizes association with the apical membrane, resulting in synergy in the combined action of Rho1 and PI(4,5)P2 in Dia apical localization. Once in the vicinity of the apical membrane, Dia can shift dynamically among three states, being bound to each of the cues alone, or to both simultaneously. This feature can increase the effective levels of apical-targeting cues, since they do not necessarily have to be used simultaneously at all times."

Although these mechanisms seem redundant, they may provide higher accuracy to the system. As previously noted, dia mRNA is also apically localized by a mechanism that is distinct from the protein localization machinery, leading to localized translation of Dia protein at the apical membrane (Massarwa et al., 2009). Indeed, we observed a more restricted apical distribution of endogenous Dia compared with the over-expressed protein, which is not localized at the RNA level (Figure 1). In addition, a bias in the apical localization of Dia activators (Rho-GEFs and Rho1) may provide another level of refinement. Finally, the bias in Rho-GEFs may be influenced by apical PI(4,5)P2 levels, providing an additional layer of convergence between distinct signals (Murray et al., 2012; Viaud et al., 2012)."

Furthermore, the link between activation and localization, as well as the identity of the critical domain for localization of formin family proteins, appear to be conserved (Carramusa et al., 2007; Watanabe et al., 2010). In this context, we have recently examined the tubular epithelium of secretory acinar cells in the mouse pancreas, and shown that activated mDia1 is targeted to the apical membrane (Geron et al., 2013). Thus, the Dia apical-targeting machinery appears to be common to a variety of tubular tissues, regardless of their origin or physiological function."

GFP-Dia-N′-mutG and GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD-mutG were created by site directed mutagenesis (Phusion, NEB), replacing nucleotides TG (440–441) with AC and AGC (451–453) with GAG, using GFP-Dia-N′ and GFP-Dia-N′ΔBD, respectively, as templates. The resulting constructs were subsequently cloned into GFP-pUAST-attB at the NotI-XbaI sites. All constructs were sequenced, and injected into attP18 lines (Markstein et al., 2008). For expression in MDCK cysts, Dia-FL and Dia-ΔDAD were cloned into pEGFP-C1 by inserting the appropriate segments from a Dia cDNA using the SalI and HindIII sites."
