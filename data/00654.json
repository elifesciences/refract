      "content": "The dynamic organization of signaling cascades inside primary cilia is key to signal propagation. Yet little is known about the dynamics of ciliary membrane proteins besides a possible role for motor-driven Intraflagellar Transport (IFT). To characterize these dynamics, we imaged single molecules of Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a GPCR) and Smoothened (Smo, a Hedgehog signal transducer) in the ciliary membrane. While IFT trains moved processively from one end of the cilium to the other, single SSTR3 and Smo underwent mostly diffusive behavior interspersed with short periods of directional movements. Statistical subtraction of instant velocities revealed that SSTR3 and Smo spent less than a third of their time undergoing active transport. Finally, SSTR3 and IFT movements could be uncoupled by perturbing either membrane protein diffusion or active transport. Thus ciliary membrane proteins move predominantly by diffusion, and attachment to IFT trains is transient and stochastic rather than processive or spatially determined."

Cilia are also involved in mediating the response to developmental signaling molecules, including Sonic Hedgehog, and may help to convert mechanical signals into electrical or chemical ones. Primary cilia are made up of an axoneme—a core structure that consists of microtubules extending along the length of the cilium—ensheathed by a membrane that contains a number of receptor proteins."

This process is mediated by motor proteins called kinesins and dyneins, which carry cargo proteins along axonemal microtubules. However, it has been difficult to study the transport of individual receptor proteins directly because they are uniformly distributed over the membranes of the cilia."

By labelling individual receptors with a fluorescent dye and then filming their movements under a microscope, Ye et al. found that the receptors generally did not show the directed, linear motion that would be expected from intraflagellar transport. Instead, much of their movement occurred through passive diffusion, with occasional short bursts of directed motion."

      "content": "To investigate how rapidly receptor molecules could move through the cilium in this way, Ye et al. used a technique called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). This involves using light to bleach the fluorescent dye attached to receptor molecules in part of the cilium, and then measuring how long it takes for the fluorescence to return as a result of other labelled molecules moving into the bleached area: the shorter this time, the faster the movement of the molecules. It took less than a minute for fluorescence to be restored within a primary cilium, indicating that passive diffusion with occasional active transport can move proteins rapidly through the structure."

A prototypical system to study how proteins explore cellular space is the primary cilium, a surface-exposed compartment consisting of a microtubule-based axoneme ensheathed within a plasma membrane protrusion (Satir and Christensen, 2007). The primary cilium is an important signaling compartment (Goetz and Anderson, 2010): entire signaling cascades, from the most upstream membrane-embedded receptors to the ultimate effectors, are dynamically concentrated within the ciliary space (Corbit et al., 2005; Haycraft et al., 2005; Rohatgi et al., 2007), and cilium dysfunction abolishes specific pathways such as Hedgehog signaling (Huangfu et al., 2003)."

In reverse, polypeptides move by dynein 1b-powered IFT from the tip to the base of cilia. The requirement of the IFT machinery for ciliary assembly, and the bidirectional movements of IFT trains in mature cilia have been substantiated in every model system tested (Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008) and it is generally accepted that soluble and membrane-embedded cargo explore the ciliary space by loading onto IFT trains at one end of the primary cilium and unloading at the other end (Qin et al., 2004; Pedersen et al., 2006). Yet, there is limited direct experimental evidence to support this model of IFT-mediated transport of ciliary membrane proteins."

While bulk imaging of some GFP-tagged ciliary membrane proteins (e.g., PKD2-GFP, OSM9-GFP) discerned a few fluorescence foci moving processively in cilia (Ou et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2007), ciliary membrane proteins are generally distributed homogeneously inside cilia and information on their dynamics is therefore lacking. Furthermore, while IFT trains have been visualized as large polymeric assemblages by electron microscopy (Pigino et al., 2009) and as clusters of fluorescence by light microscopy (Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008), the IFT entities that ferry cargoes remain elusive."

To facilitate cilia visualization, SSTR3 and Smo were tagged at the intracellular C-terminus with a fluorescent protein (SSTR3-GFP and Smo-YFP). In order to detect single molecules we also fused a biotinylation acceptor peptide (AP) to the extracellular N-terminus of SSTR3 or Smo, and co-expressed the biotin ligase BirA in the ER of the stable cell lines (Howarth and Ting, 2008). Proteins were expressed stably and at low levels in IMCD3-Flp-In cells."

Under these conditions, SSTR3-GFP and Smo-YFP were distributed homogeneously in cilia, but each cilium contained between zero and five dots of mSA-A647 labelled molecules (referred hereafter as single SSTR3 or Smo molecule) (Figure 1B); cilia orientation was determined by co-expressing pericentrin-RFP (PCNT; Gillingham and Munro, 2000) which localizes to the basal body at the base of the cilium (Figure 1B). Single molecule imaging was performed at 2 Hz until fluorescence of mSA was lost due to bleaching (30–60 s).

By using bright foci of RFP-tagged IFT88 as markers of motor-driven IFT trains, we found that the saltatory movement of SSTR3 was clearly different from the smooth, processive movement of IFT trains in the same cilia (Figure 1C). Furthermore, not only were the movements of IFT trains and single SSTR3 molecules different, their tracks rarely overlapped even when single SSTR3 molecules displayed short directional movements (Figure 1D, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). These observations indicate that SSTR3 and Smo moved primarily by diffusion in the ciliary membrane, and that very small IFT trains might actively move single SSTR3 molecules; these IFT nanotrains are below the sensitivity limit of our imaging."

We had previously uncovered a diffusion barrier at the ciliary base by showing that photobleaching Smo-YFP or SSTR3-GFP in the entire cilium led to no detectable recovery from its plasma membrane pool (Hu et al., 2010). However, photobleaching Smo-YFP (Hu et al., 2010) or SSTR3-GFP (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and Video 3) in the distal half of the cilium led to fluorescence recovery in less than 60 s at the expense of signal diffusing from the proximal, unbleached half (Hu et al., 2010). While this experiment did not distinguish between diffusion and active transport, it showed that the saltatory movements of SSTR3 and Smo are compatible with rapid exploration of the entire ciliary space."

Importantly, comparing the mobility of SSTR3 in the presence or absence of saturating amounts of mSA showed that our single molecule labeling strategy did not affect SSTR3 mobility (Figure 2A–C). In addition, our tagging and labeling strategy does not disrupt the signaling properties of SSTR3 since AP-SSTR3-GFP underwent agonist-induced endocytosis from the plasma membrane, a common feature of GPCRs upon activation (Figure 2D). These results lead us to conclude that our single molecule imaging reflects the dynamics of functional SSTR3 molecules."

The combination of motor-driven velocities and diffusive velocities found in live cells was deconvolved by effectively removing motor-driven transport, thus isolating diffusive events. Since the IFT motors kinesin II and dynein 1b require ATP to power active transport, we depleted ATP using two independent approaches. First, we added antimycin and deoxyglucose to cells to interrupt mitochondrial respiration and anaerobic glycolysis. This treatment reduced cellular ATP levels by 90% (Figure 3C), indicating that some ATP generation system(s) remained (e.g., phosphocreatine). Nevertheless, this treatment inhibited all IFT88 foci movements (Figure 3A). However, the saltatory movements of single SSTR3 molecule in the same cilia were unaffected (Figure 3B, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1)."

Since kinesin II and dynein 1b each move at characteristic velocities (Scholey, 2008), motor-driven movements of single SSTR3 molecules should be enriched in the distribution of instant velocities along the cilium in control cells vs antimycin/deoxyglucose-treated cells (Figure 3D). Differences between distributions were analyzed by performing an effective histogram subtraction (‘Materials and methods’). Anterograde and retrograde velocities were binned separately to create histograms with an optimum bin size that generated an unbiased estimate of the distributions (Scott, 1979). Using nonlinear least-squares regression, the live cell velocity histogram was fitted to a mixed distribution consisting of fraction f of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance and fraction (1−f) of the antimycin/deoxyglucose-treated cell distribution. This, and two other (‘Materials and methods’), unbiased statistical tests were highly significant for both anterograde and retrograde SSTR3 velocities, and indicated that 27% of anterograde and 13% of retrograde movements of SSTR3 involved active transport (Figure 3D)."

This results in depletion of cytoplasmic ciliary contents including motors and ATP (Figure 4A, top panel). As expected, this treatment reduced the ATP concentration to undetectable levels (Figure 4E, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Significantly, IFT foci movements were completely inhibited, while SSTR3 molecules retained their saltatory behavior (Figure 4A, and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Again, three unbiased statistical tests found highly significant differences in the distribution of instant velocities between untreated and digitonin-treated cells. Applying the same effective subtraction of instant velocities as done for antimycin/deoxyglucose-treated cells, we found that 22% of anterograde and 24% of retrograde movements of SSTR3 involved active transport (Figure 4B). Importantly, the mean of the Gaussians representing the differences of instant velocities between untreated and digitonin-permeabilized cells aligned closely with the mean velocities of IFT foci movements (Figure 4D). This strongly suggests that the active transport events detected by our statistical subtraction are powered by the IFT motors kinesin II and dynein 1b."

A possible interpretation is that dynein 1b retains some ability to operate under load at low ATP levels while kinesin II is fully inactive when ATP levels are reduced 10-fold. Interestingly, FRAP analysis showed that the mobility of SSTR3-GFP was similar in untreated and digitonin-treated cells (Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 3, and Video 3). This result strongly suggests that the combination of passive diffusion and active transport (by nanotrains, see above) are effective at enabling membrane proteins to explore the ciliary space."

      "content": "An alternative strategy to inhibit active transport is to use ciliobrevin (Figure 5A), which selectively inhibits dynein but not kinesins (Firestone et al., 2012). Treatment of cells with ciliobrevin resulted in the rapid and progressive inhibition of retrograde movement of IFT88 foci (within approximately 2–3 min; Figure 5B), and after 30 min anterograde movements were also inhibited (Figure 5A). Inhibition of anterograde IFT88 movement by ciliobrevin was unexpected since this direction of movement involves kinesin II, which is not targeted by ciliobrevin (Firestone et al., 2012). It is possible that dynein is involved in the delivery of IFT complexes (including kinesin II) from the cytoplasm to the base of the cilium for anterograde transport, and that inhibition of dynein gradually reduces the replenishment of these complexes in the cilium. Ciliobrevin did not affect single SSTR3 molecule movements in the ciliary membrane (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and Video 3); moreover, the same statistical tests that had been performed on the data from the digitonin and the antimycin/deoxyglucose treatments (Figure 3D, and Figure 4B,C) failed to uncover a significant difference between the distributions of SSTR3 velocities in control and ciliobrevin-treated cells (Figure 5C). FRAP analysis also showed that the mobility of SSTR3-GFP (Figure 5A, Figure 5—figure supplement 2, and Video 3) was similar in untreated and ciliobrevin-treated cells."

This raises questions about the relationship between IFT and active transport of SSTR3, especially since directional tracks of single SSTR3 molecules rarely overlapped with movements of large IFT88 foci in control cells (Figure 1D, and Figure 1—figure supplement 2). As noted above, it is possible that the majority of directional SSTR3 movements are mediated by IFT nanotrains that are smaller than the IFT88 foci that we can resolve, and which might be less sensitive to dynein inhibition. Although ciliobrevin has been shown to inhibit dynein in gliding assays (Firestone et al., 2012), it is also possible that it is less potent against dynein under specific loads such as those corresponding to very small IFT nanotrains. Another possibility is that directional SSTR3 movements occurred on other motors (Hao et al., 2011) that are not inhibited by ciliobrevin."

This predicts that the movement of IFT trains is a constitutive process largely independent of binding to cargo such as SSTR3. Since surface-exposed membrane proteins like SSTR3 are glycosylated, multivalent lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) will cross-link and immobilize them in the ciliary membrane (Golan et al., 1986). Indeed, addition of WGA completely stopped SSTR3 movements within minutes as measured by single molecule imaging and half-cilium photobleaching (Figure 6A, Figure 6—figure supplements 1 and 2, and Video 3). However, WGA addition had only a small, albeit statistically significant effect on IFT movements (Figure 6B–D, and Video 4). Since WGA binds to nearly all membrane proteins, we can extrapolate these results to conclude that IFT88 movements can be largely uncoupled from binding to ciliary membrane protein cargo."

      "content": "By following the movements of single membrane proteins in the primary cilium, we find that previous models of cargo loading onto IFT trains are no longer tenable. While every evidence point to IFT trains assembling at one end of the cilium and then being transported by an IFT motor all the way to the other extremity of the cilium, keeping their state of assembly intact along the way, we find instead that cargo are highly labile components of IFT trains. Our finding that immobilization of membrane proteins (cargoes) only minimally affected IFT train formation and movement suggests that IFT trains assemble spontaneously rather than ‘on demand’ by binding cargo; this is similar in principle to the cargo-independent assembly of clathrin-coated pits (Cocucci et al., 2012). In our model (Figure 6E), IFT trains assemble spontaneously at a given frequency at the base and tip of cilia, forming conveyor belts along the length of the cilium onto which membrane cargo can hop on and off. While this model would at first glance appear to contradict prior findings of PKD2-GFP and OSM9-GFP foci moving processively along cilia (Ou et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2007), it is likely that this is due to differences between ensemble and single molecule imaging. For example, it is possible that each IFT train carries a constant number of cargo molecules but individual cargo molecules continually hop on and off; ensemble imagining would not detect these individual events which we could detect here at the single molecule level. Thus membrane protein transport in cilia may be reminiscent of the slow axonal transport pathway in which most proteins synthesized in the neuronal body move at an apparent slow rate along the axon because they infrequently hop onto motors (Scott et al., 2011)."

      "content": "Another interpretation of our data is that proteins undergo advective movements created by the constant movements of large IFT trains up or down the cilium. The influence of fluid motion to particle movements can be measured by the Péclet number Pe = UR/D where U is the speed of fluid motion, R is the radius of the structure and D the diffusion coefficient. If Pe < 1, diffusion outpaces the speeds of fluid motion and the contribution of fluid motion to particle transport are minimal (Goldstein et al., 2008). In the case of the cilium, U is of the order of IFT motor speeds (10−4 cm/s), R is ∼10−5 cm and D is 2 × 10−9 cm2/s for SSTR3 and 10 × 10−9 cm2/s for a typical protein such as tubulin. The calculated values of Pe are thus 0.5 for SSTR3 and 0.1 for tubulin, thereby suggesting that passive advection plays a very minor role in the movement of typical proteins inside cilia. Moreover, the passive advection model is incompatible with our finding that IFT foci movements can be interrupted without affecting active transport of SSTR3 (Figure 5). This experiment suggests that unresolvable IFT nanotrains transport SSTR3 when cells are exposed to ciliobrevin, and that large IFT trains visualized as readily detectable foci of fluorescence may be devoid of cargo and represent recycling IFT complexes. The hypothesis that IFT nanotrains, possibly reduced to single IFT complexes bridging a cargo to a motor, represent the transporting entities is in line with nearly all other example of motor-cargo adaptors (Hirokawa et al., 2009). An alternative hypothesis is that ciliobrevin creates an artificial situation in cilia that forces cargo to utilize IFT nanotrains that are not normally found in cilia. A resolution of these possibilities will require advanced imaging approaches that are capable of detecting single molecules of IFT complexes."

Indeed, the diffusion coefficient of SSTR3 (D= 0.25 μm2/s; Figure 5—figure supplement 2B) indicates that a single SSTR3 molecule could diffuse along the length of a 4 μm cilium in less than 40 s, while IFT-mediated transport would complete the same trip in 8 s. Interestingly, the dimensions of a cilium are similar to those of a bacterium in which proteins rapidly explore the cellular space by diffusion in the absence of cytoskeletal motors (Elowitz et al., 1999). The importance of diffusion in exploration of the ciliary space does not rule out other roles for IFT in ciliogenesis, or the possible formation of IFT scaffolds for signaling cascades (Pan and Snell, 2002; Wang et al., 2006).

Serum-starved IMCD3 cells on coverslips were first placed on an ice-chilled metal block and washed twice with cold Digitonin Assay Buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mM KOAc, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA). For cell permeabilization, coverslips were incubated for 7 min in cold Digitonin Assay Buffer supplemented with 30 μg/ml digitonin and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, bestatin, aprotinin, AEBSF, and E-64). After permeabilization, coverslips were washed twice with Digitonin Assay Buffer and processed for subsequent imaging assays. For WGA treatment, cells were incubated with 75 μg/ml WGA for 7 min immediately prior to imaging. To test the signaling response of AP-SSTR3-GFP, HEK293T cells were transfected with AP-SSTR3-GFP and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 hr and them treated with 10 μM Octreotide or Somatostatin (SST) immediately before live cell imaging."

The anterograde and retrograde velocities were separately binned to create histograms with an optimum bin size designed to generate an unbiased estimate of the distributions (Scott, 1979). Using nonlinear least-squares, the live cell velocity histogram was fitted to a mixed distribution consisting of fraction f of a Gaussian with unknown mean and variance and fraction (1−f) of the permeabilized cell distribution. For anterograde velocities, the fitted fraction in the additional Gaussian was f = 0.22 ± 0.13. The fitted Gaussian had a mean at 0.41 ± 0.14 μm/s and a standard deviation 0.26 ± 0.12 μm/s. An F-test was used to establish that the fitted mixed distribution fitted the live cell anterograde velocity data significantly better compared to the permeabilized cell distribution alone (p=10−5, justifying the three additional degrees of freedom). For retrograde velocities, we fitted a fraction f = 0.24 ± 0.06 in the additional Gaussian, which had a mean at 0.30 ± 0.10 μm/s and a standard deviation 0.28 ± 0.06 μm/s. The F-test statistic established that the mixed distribution yielded a significant improvement in fitting the retrograde velocity data (p=10−5)."

Further, there are no functional studies. Just because the receptor they looked at can spread out and looks more or less 'o.k.' as far as distribution does not mean that overall function does not depend on active transport. Further, are the transient interactions with motors that they suggest relevant/important for function?"

If the receptor usually forms a complex, but said complex is altered due to the labeling, the ability of the receptor to diffuse would be significantly altered-size and variety of interactions can influence efficacy of diffusion a lot. So, just because a small uncomplexed receptor can diffuse does not mean that a larger one can/will. At the very least, things will depend on size of things. This is ignored."

In theory diffusion should account for the exploration of the entire ciliary membrane surface by membrane proteins. A series of experiments using FRAP to measure behaviour of SSTR3 (a membrane protein) are most consistent with diffusion. Furthermore, conditions that reduce active transport such as ATP depletion or inhibition of dynein using ciliobrevin have little effect on the behavior of SSTR3. This would not exclude a role of active transport in restricting membrane proteins to subdomains of the membrane, although this would not appear to be relevant for SSTR3."

The only alternative treatment that we could use to inhibit IFT motors would be to deplete dynein 1b or kinesin-II using siRNA.

The authors imaged singly biotinylated Somatostatin Receptor 3 (SSTR3, a ciliary GPCR) labeled with fluorescent monovalent streptavidin. We don't know what the labeling does to the function/transport of the receptor [Reviewer 2]. The other major concern is whether the tagged SSTR3 is correctly targeted and functional? Addressing the functional significance of the tagged SSTR3 is an important issue, albeit technically difficult [editorial letter]."
